53f45728dabfaec09f209538,null,53e99784b7602d9701f3e133,"Drought is the first place in all the natural disasters in the world. It is especially serious in North China Plain. In this paper, different soil water content control levels at winter wheat growth stages are performed on Gucheng Ecological-Meteorological Integrated Observation Experiment Station of CAMS, China. Some canopy parameters, including growth conditions, dry weight, physiological parameters and hyperspectral reflectance, are measured from erecting stage to milk stage for winter wheat in 2009. The relationship between canopy parameters and soil relative moisture, canopy water content and water indices of winter wheat are established. The results show that some parameters, such as SPAD and dry weight of leaves, decrease with the increasing of soil relative moisture, while other parameters, including dry weight of caudexes, above ground dry weight, height, photosynthesis rate, intercellular CO 2 concentration, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, increase corresponding to the soil relative moisture. Obvious linear relationship between stomatal conductance and transpiration rate is established with 45 samples, which R2 reaches to 0.6152. Finally, the fitting equations between canopy water content and water indices are regressed with b5, b6 and b7 of MODIS bands. The equations are best with b7 and worst with b5. So the fitting equations with b7 can be used to inverse the canopy water content of winter wheat using MODIS or other remote sensing images with similar bands range to MODIS in Hebei Province. © 2011 IEEE.","[{""_id"":""53f45728dabfaec09f209538"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Peijuan Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5601754345cedb3395e59457"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jiahua Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f38438dabfae4b34a08928"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Donghui Xie"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5601754345cedb3395e5945a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yanyan Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43d25dabfaeecd6995149"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yun Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049503,"[""Agronomy"",""Moisture"",""Hydrology"",""Environmental science"",""Dry weight"",""Water content"",""Stomatal conductance"",""Transpiration"",""Irrigation"",""Soil water"",""Canopy""]",,,null,"[""canopy parameters"",""canopy spectrum"",""different soil water content control"",""winter wheat"",""irrigation"",""hydrology"",""radiometry"",""moisture"",""indexes"",""vegetation"",""indexation"",""dry weight"",""soil moisture"",""water content"",""indexing terms"",""spectrum"",""natural disaster""]",en,0,1933,1930,null,null,The relationship between canopy parameters and spectrum of winter wheat under different irrigations in Hebei Province.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049503""]","{""_id"":""53a7297d20f7420be8bd4ae7"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IGARSS"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",null,2011,"{""_id"":""53f45728dabfaec09f209538"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Peijuan Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",Peijuan Wang

560175b545cedb3395e59d80,null,53e99784b7602d9701f3eaf6,"There is a growing interest in the potential of software agent technologies for building the next generation of advanced software systems that will help solving problems that require advanced user interactions and intensive collaborations. Despite this interest, software agents are not yet widespread due to many reasons, one of which is the heavy programming work that has to be done in order to create efficient and effective agent systems, particularly from the point of view of agents' characteristics, such as autonomy and deliberation on one hand, and integration with other technologies and applications on the other. While several agent platforms implement the belief-desire-intention (BDI architecture have been proposed, most of these platforms are implemented based on existing general purpose programming languages, e.g. Java. As a consequence, this prevents the use of advanced features of the underlying programming language and the integration with new technologies and paradigms that are essential for the development of enterprise applications. Due to these limitations of the existing platforms, a new BDI distributed agent platform design and implementation is proposed in this paper. The CloudNetBDI platform prototype is compliant with the specifications of the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA and has been implemented in the .NET framework. The CloudNetBDI platform employs the BDI model as an internal reasoning engine for its agents. Furthermore, the CloudNetBDI platform provides an interface for developers to design and develop enriched, robust and autonomous BDI based distributed multi-agent systems.","[{""_id"":""560175b545cedb3395e59d80"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""C.

53f42d5edabfaedce54c5021,null,53e99784b7602d9701f3eaf6,"There is a growing interest in the potential of software agent technologies for building the next generation of advanced software systems that will help solving problems that require advanced user interactions and intensive collaborations. Despite this interest, software agents are not yet widespread due to many reasons, one of which is the heavy programming work that has to be done in order to create efficient and effective agent systems, particularly from the point of view of agents' characteristics, such as autonomy and deliberation on one hand, and integration with other technologies and applications on the other. While several agent platforms implement the belief-desire-intention (BDI architecture have been proposed, most of these platforms are implemented based on existing general purpose programming languages, e.g. Java. As a consequence, this prevents the use of advanced features of the underlying programming language and the integration with new technologies and paradigms that are essential for the development of enterprise applications. Due to these limitations of the existing platforms, a new BDI distributed agent platform design and implementation is proposed in this paper. The CloudNetBDI platform prototype is compliant with the specifications of the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA and has been implemented in the .NET framework. The CloudNetBDI platform employs the BDI model as an internal reasoning engine for its agents. Furthermore, the CloudNetBDI platform provides an interface for developers to design and develop enriched, robust and autonomous BDI based distributed multi-agent systems.","[{""_id"":""560175b545cedb3395e59d80"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""C.
