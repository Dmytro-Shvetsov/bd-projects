53e997ddb7602d9701fd4641,"Analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of respirable suspended particulates (RSP observed in 11 Hong Kong general stations over the period 2000-2008 shows a high concentration in the northwest and low concentration in the southeast and coastal areas, with the central area in between. Seasonally, RSP concentration is highest in winter, followed by autumn, and is lowest in summer. A bimodal peak in diurnal cycle with peaks in the morning (7-8 a.m. and early evening (6-7 p.m. can be attributed to rush-hour traffic flows as well as local land-sea breeze circulations. The effect of vehicular emission is also demonstrated in a distinct weekly cycle, with a Sunday minimum. Analysis of RSP concentration for different wind directions shows the importance of cross-boundary transport of pollutants from the Pearl River Delta area, with 43% of noncompliant cases associated with cross-boundary transport. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF analysis shows that the first EOF pattern of RSP changes is characterized by changes of the same sign for all 11 general stations, with the second pattern dominated by changes in the Yuen Long station. Time series analysis shows that changes in the second EOF leads the first, indicating that changes in Yuen Long (northwest precede changes elsewhere. Stations located in the coastal area change last. Tap Mun shows significant increasing trends in RSP concentration, particularly for incidences of high RSP occurrences, which may be attributed to increases in shipping in the Yan Tian International Container Terminal. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","[{""_id"":""53f43873dabfaedce554235a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Long Sang Chiu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42d9fdabfaee1c0a36b9a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Raymond Kwok-Cheung Lok"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1080/19475683.2011.576269,"[""Meteorology"",""Particulates"",""Evening"",""Pollution"",""Pollutant"",""Wind direction"",""Atmospheric sciences"",""Empirical orthogonal functions"",""Diurnal cycle"",""Morning"",""Geography""]",,19475691,2,"[""cross-boundary transport"",""pearl river delta"",""pollution"",""rsp"",""time series analysis"",""empirical orthogonal function"",""diurnal cycle"",""sea breeze"",""seasonality"",""traffic flow""]",en,0,124,113,null,"[""53e9b0ccb7602d9703b479d1""]",Variations of respirable suspended particulates in Hong Kong: cross-boundary and local effects.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19475683.2011.576269""]","{""_id"":""555036f87cea80f95416b5fe"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Annals of Gis: Geographic Information Sciences"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Annals of GIS"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",17,2011
53e997ddb7602d9701fd5c11,"Nowadays, numerous social videos have pervaded on the Web. Social web videos are characterized with the accompanying rich contextual information which describe the content of videos and thus greatly facilitate video search and browsing. Generally those context data such as tags are generated for the whole video, without temporal indication on when they actually appear in the video. However, many tags only describe parts of the video content. Therefore, tag localization, the process of assigning tags to the underlying relevant video segments or frames is gaining increasing research interests and a benchmark dataset for the fair evaluation of tag localization algorithms is highly desirable. In this paper, we describe and release a dataset called DUT-WEBV, which contains 1550 videos collected from YouTube portal by issuing 31 concepts as queries. These concepts cover a wide range of semantic aspects including scenes like ""mountain"", events like ""flood"", objects like ""cows"", sites like ""gas station"", and activities like ""handshaking"", offering great challenges to the tag (i.e., concept localization task. For each video of a tag, we carefully annotate the time durations when the tag appears in the video. Besides the video itself, the contextual information, such as thumbnail images, titles, and categories, is also provided. Together with this benchmark dataset, we present a baseline for tag localization using multiple instance learning approach. Finally, we discuss some open research issues for tag localization in web videos. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""54084d74dabfae450f40a183"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Haojie Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43277dabfaec09f154ff5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lei Yi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa014edabfae8faa59f244"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yue Guan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4714ddabfaeb22f5592bd"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hao Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_29,"[""Open research"",""Thumbnail"",""Contextual information"",""World Wide Web"",""Social web"",""Information retrieval"",""Video retrieval"",""Computer science"",""Video annotation"",""Handshaking"",""Context data""]",,16113349,2,"[""tag localization"",""video annotation"",""video retrieval""]",en,10,315,305,null,"[""53e9ba94b7602d97046b9e43"",""53e9b27bb7602d9703d213ed"",""53e998b8b7602d97020f1238"",""53e99e31b7602d97026f707b"",""53e9bb8cb7602d97047d329e"",""53e9bda5b7602d9704a4f32a"",""53e9b03db7602d9703a9b031"",""53e9b8c1b7602d97044a2ec0"",""53e9a2b9b7602d9702bc019e"",""53e99f64b7602d97028348f5"",""53e9a04ab7602d97029326c3"",""53e99e94b7602d970275cb91"",""53e9b937b7602d97045221ad"",""53e99c52b7602d9702500b5f"",""558c5f1784ae6766fdf2b146"",""53e9a7b3b7602d97030eca94"",""53e9b3d4b7602d9703ebe970"",""53e99a6eb7602d97022dfb95"",""53e9b627b7602d970417fdae""]",DUT-WEBV: A Benchmark Dataset for Performance Evaluation of Tag Localization for Web Video.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_29""]","{""_id"":""53a72cac20f7420be8c4c673"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Conference on Multimedia Modeling"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7733,2013

53e997ccb7602d9701fbe663,"Compared with other existing video coding standards, H.264/AVC can achieve a significant improvement in compression performances.
 A robust criterion named the rate distortion optimization (RDO is employed to select the optimal coding modes and motion
 vectors for each macroblock (MB, which achieves a high compression ratio while leading to a great increase in the complexity
 and computational load unfortunately. In this paper, a fast mode decision algorithm for H.264/AVC intra prediction based on
 integer transform and adaptive threshold is proposed. Before the intra prediction, integer transform operations on the original
 image are executed to find the directions of local textures. According to this direction, only a small part of the possible
 intra prediction modes are tested for RDO calculation at the first step. If the minimum mean absolute error (MMAE of the
 reconstructed block corresponding to the best mode is smaller than an adaptive threshold which depends on the quantization
 parameter (QP, the RDO calculation is terminated. Otherwise, more possible modes need to be tested. The adaptive threshold
 aims to balance the compression performance and the computational load. Simulation results with various video sequences show
 that the fast mode decision algorithm proposed in this paper can accelerate the encoding speed significantly only with negligible

53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b,"A fundamental challenge in data center networking is how to efficiently interconnect an exponentially increasing number of servers. This paper presents DCell, a novel network structure that has many desirable features for data center networking. DCell is a recursively defined structure, in which a high-level DCell is constructed from many low-level DCells and DCells at the same level are fully connected with one another. DCell scales doubly exponentially as the node degree increases. DCell is fault tolerant since it does not have single point of failure and its distributed fault-tolerant routing protocol performs near shortest-path routing even in the presence of severe link or node failures. DCell also provides higher network capacity than the traditional tree-based structure for various types of services. Furthermore, DCell can be incrementally expanded and a partial DCell provides the same appealing features. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that DCell is a viable interconnection structure for data centers.","[{""_id"":""53f7a457dabfae9060ad6dfd"",""bio"":null,""email"":""chguo@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Chuanxiong Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a50f5dabfae61d4969d02"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hwu@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Haitao Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54084fdedabfae44f087b22e"",""bio"":null,""email"":""kuntan@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Kun Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f5634adabfae5e5bf80463"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Lei Shi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4630fdabfaeb22f52f212"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ygz@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Yongguang Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4792fdabfaec09f2882e2"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zslu@cs.ucla.edu"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Songwu Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1145/1402946.1402968,"[""Single point of failure"",""Data center network architectures"",""Computer science"",""Server"",""Computer network"",""Network topology"",""Bisection bandwidth"",""Fault tolerance"",""Distributed computing"",""Routing protocol"",""Scalability""]",,01464833,4,"[""data center"",""network topology"",""throughput"",""fault tolerance""]",en,1143,86,75,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b_0.pdf,"[""53e99d4bb7602d9702602ec7"",""53e99adcb7602d9702360f1e"",""53e9ac2eb7602d97035f4104"",""599c7f2d601a182cd28f68d5"",""53e9ab69b7602d970350990d"",""557cf1336feeaa8086da40ad"",""53e99b78b7602d970241f5f5"",""53e99cfdb7602d97025b2103"",""55827efb0cf2bf7bae57aa4e"",""53e9bb52b7602d9704790954""]",Dcell: a scalable and fault-tolerant network structure for data centers,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402946.1402968"",""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555037717cea80f9541880b1"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SIGCOMM"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",38,2008

53e997d1b7602d9701fc7844,"Describing the interactional behavior of rational agents and seeking equilibria are two main domains of game theory. The epistemic
 foundation of the above two domains is based on the assumption that all players are rational. However, game theory itself
 cannot precisely model the higher-order information changes of mutual knowledge among players, so in the current studies of
 game theory the interpretations of rationality are vague. In this paper, a concept of the rationality is redefined through
 incorporating an epistemic ingredient. Then a method is proposed to solve and refine Nash equilibria which is grounded on
 public announcement logic, and it is proved that the iterated announcement of this rationality assertion characterizes the
 iterated admissibility algorithm in game theory, which offers a dynamic epistemic foundation for this algorithm. Finally,
 an implementation of this method, based on the extended DEMO, is shown to be correct.","[{""_id"":""542ce599dabfae4b91c2cdf9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869d13e1cd8e14a3a02894"",""name"":""JianYing Cui"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest University Institute of Logic and Intelligence Chongqing 400715 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b35e1c455f439fe42616"",""orgs"":[""Southwest Univ, Inst Log & Intelligence, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f471a4dabfaee02adc0c34"",""bio"":null,""email"":""tangxj@swu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b869d13e1cd8e14a3a02894"",""name"":""XiaoJia Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest University Institute of Logic and Intelligence Chongqing 400715 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b35e1c455f439fe42616"",""orgs"":[""Southwest Univ, Inst Log & Intelligence, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-010-4010-0,"[""Mathematical economics"",""Rationality"",""Rational agent"",""Best response"",""Implementation theory"",""Non-credible threat"",""Game theory"",""Normal-form game"",""Nash equilibrium"",""Mathematics""]",,18622836,7,"[""game theory"",""rational agent"",""higher order"",""nash equilibria""]",en,4,1368,1358,null,"[""53e9a3b3b7602d9702cc39d6"",""56d90d12dabfae2eee23a549"",""53e9a42bb7602d9702d48474"",""53e9b572b7602d97040ab1f5"",""53e99cfcb7602d97025af166"",""53e99d45b7602d97025fd240"",""53e9ac3db7602d9703606fb6""]",A method for solving Nash equilibria of games based on public announcement logic,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-010-4010-0"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-010-4010-0"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b77cea80f95414b7de"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",53,2010

In this paper, we propose Bayesian cluster ensemble (BCE, which is a mixed-membership model for learning cluster ensembles, and is applicable to all the primary variants of the problem.

We compare BCE extensively with several other cluster ensemble algorithms, and demonstrate that BCE is not only versatile in terms of its applicability but also outperforms other algorithms in terms of stability and accuracy. Moreover, GBCE can have higher accuracy than BCE, especially with only a small number of available base clusterings. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

53e997cbb7602d9701fbbb9a,"Interactive image matting is a process that extracts a foreground object from an image based on limited user input. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive image matting algorithm named Perfect Snapping which is inspired by the presented method named Lazy Snapping technique. In the algorithm, the mean shift algorithm with a boundary confidence prior is introduced to efficiently pre-segment the original image into homogeneous regions (super-pixels with precise boundary. Secondly, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM clustering algorithm is used to describe and to model the super-pixels. Finally, a Monte Carlo based Expectation Maximization (EM algorithm is used to perform parametric learning of mixture model for priori knowledge. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher matting quality with higher efficiency. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""56cb1899c35f4f3c6565413c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qingsong Zhu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""560196de45cedb3395e7efd5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ling Shao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f48c16dabfaea7cd1ce195"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qi Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42e44dabfaee0d9b087e6"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaoqin Xie"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_8,null,null,16113349,2,"[""Interactive image matting"",""Lazy snapping"",""Mean shift algorithm""]",en,0,87,79,,null,Perfect Snapping.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_8""]","{""_id"":""53a72cac20f7420be8c4c673"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":null}",7733,2013
53e99796b7602d9701f6282f,"While the geographical tag has brought a novel insight into the multimedia content analysis and understanding, how to improve the tagging accuracy has been rarely exploited. In this paper, we present a novel geographical retagging algorithm to improve the inaccurate geographical tags from an automatic photo content based association and refinement perspective. We do not resort to the time-consuming camera pose estimation and scene geometry recovery schemes like structure-from-motion. Instead, our algorithm is deployed based on a very simple neighbor statistical significance test, i.e., geographically nearby images, if near duplicate, should follow a more smooth affine transform comparing with those farther aways. Such an assumption is robust to noisy photo contents caused by multiple factors, such as indoor/outdoor changes, occlusions, or viewing angle changes. It is also very fast comparing to alternative approaches like structure-from-motion or simultaneous localization and matching. We have shown the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed retagging algorithm for refining the geographical tags of Flickr images. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""53f42fb7dabfaec09f131d6b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Liujuan Cao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yue Gao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5601814545cedb3395e65f53"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiong Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Rongrong Ji"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_5,null,null,16113349,2,"[""Flickr images."",""Geographical tagging"",""Social media"",""Statistical significance testing"",""Tag refinement""]",en,3,57,47,,null,Geographical Retagging.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_5""]","{""_id"":""53a72cac20f7420be8c4c673"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":null}",7733,2013

53e997f1b7602d9701ff52ce,"  This paper introduces an algorithm for the nonnegative matrix factorization-and-completion problem, which aims to find nonnegative low-rank matrices X and Y so that the product XY approximates a nonnegative data matrix M whose elements are partially known (to a certain accuracy. This problem aggregates two existing problems: (i nonnegative matrix factorization where all entries of M are given, and (ii low-rank matrix completion where nonnegativity is not required. By taking the advantages of both nonnegativity and low-rankness, one can generally obtain superior results than those of just using one of the two properties. We propose to solve the non-convex constrained least-squares problem using an algorithm based on the classic alternating direction augmented Lagrangian method. Preliminary convergence properties of the algorithm and numerical simulation results are presented. Compared to a recent algorithm for nonnegative matrix factorization, the proposed algorithm produces factorizations of similar quality using only about half of the matrix entries. On tasks of recovering incomplete grayscale and hyperspectral images, the proposed algorithm yields overall better qualities than those produced by two recent matrix-completion algorithms that do not exploit nonnegativity.

53e997bdb7602d9701fa824e,"We propose a new texture editing operation called texture splicing. For this op eration, we regard a texture as having repetitive elements (textons seamlessly distributed in a particular patte rn. Taking two textures as input, texture splicing generates a new texture by selecting the texton appearance from one texture and distribution from the other. Texture splicing involves self-similarity search to extract the distrib ution, distribution warping, context- dependent warping, and finally, texture refinement to preserve over all appearance. We show a variety of results to illustrate this operation.","[{""_id"":""542a1b17dabfae61d4954c45"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yiming Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2234092""},{""_id"":""53f456c5dabfaefedbb51d9f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jiaping Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2147279""},{""_id"":""53f46c5adabfaee02adac85f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Su Xue"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""3570075""},{""_id"":""5601b98045cedb3395ea5140"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xin Tong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""948252""},{""_id"":""53f42c35dabfaeb22f3f66f4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Sing Bing Kang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""932237""},{""_id"":""53f79a3adabfae938c6c5ae8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Baining Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""1712205""}]",10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01569.x,null,null,14678659,7,"[""null""]",en,9,1915,1907,,null,Texture Splicing,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01569.x""]","{""_id"":""555036f07cea80f954166eba"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Comput.

53e997e3b7602d9701fd8d25,"Proof-Carrying Code brings two big challenges to the research field of programming languages. One is to seek more expressive
 logics or type systems to specify or reason about the properties of low-level or high-level programs. The other is to study
 the technology of certifying compilation in which the compiler generates proofs for programs with annotations. This paper
 presents our progress in the above two aspects. A pointer logic was designed for PointerC (a C-like programming language
 in our research. As an extension of Hoare logic, our pointer logic expresses the change of pointer information for each statement
 in its inference rules to support program verification. Meanwhile, based on the ideas from CAP (Certified Assembly Programming
 and SCAP (Stack-based Certified Assembly Programming, a reasoning framework was built to verify the properties of object
 code in a Hoare style. And a certifying compiler prototype for PointerC was implemented based on this framework.
 
 The main contribution of this paper is the design of the pointer logic and the implementation of the certifying compiler prototype.
 In our certifying compiler, the source language contains rich pointer types and operations and also supports dynamic storage
 allocation and deallocation.","[{""_id"":""53f353dbdabfae4b349541fb"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86a069e1cd8e14a3b76ea7"",""name"":""Yiyun Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""University of Science and Technology of China Department of Computer Science and Technology Hefei 230027 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e380"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a588ddabfae61d496ecd4"",""bio"":null,""email"":""gelin@mail.ustc.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b868ed4e1cd8e14a341ece9"",""name"":""GE Lin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Computer Science and Technology|University of Science and Technology of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e380"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4369fdabfaeb1a7bf5cac"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868ed4e1cd8e14a341ece9"",""name"":""HUA Baojian"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Computer Science and Technology|University of Science and Technology of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e380"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f44c15dabfaeecd69c39be"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86a069e1cd8e14a3b76ea7"",""name"":""Zhaopeng Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""University of Science and Technology of China Department of Computer Science and Technology Hefei 230027 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e380"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868ed4e1cd8e14a341ece9"",""name"":""LIU Cheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Computer Science and Technology|University of Science and Technology of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e380"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54089e0adabfae450f42eefe"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868ed4e1cd8e14a341ece9"",""name"":""WANG Zhifang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Computer Science and Technology|University of Science and Technology of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e380"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11704-007-0029-9,"[""Pointer (computer programming"",""Separation logic"",""Function pointer"",""Programming language"",""Functional compiler"",""Escape analysis"",""Computer science"",""Compiler correctness"",""Hoare logic"",""Compiler""]",,16737466,3,"[""software safety"",""Hoare logic"",""pointer logic"",""Proof-Carrying Code"",""certifying compiler""]",en,26,312,297,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997e3b7602d9701fd8d25_0.pdf,"[""53e9a4f2b7602d9702e1109a"",""53e99ab2b7602d970232a182"",""53e99827b7602d970204ab52"",""53e998bfb7602d97020f7d2b"",""53e9abe4b7602d970359ef4b"",""599c7908601a182cd260deed"",""53e9a5beb7602d9702ee5995"",""53e99f42b7602d9702814555"",""53e9aa67b7602d97033de2db"",""53e9b0d8b7602d9703b56103"",""53e9ad26b7602d9703706b09"",""53e99f94b7602d9702866c4f"",""53e9ae17b7602d9703827224"",""53e9a930b7602d970327fca7"",""53e9b488b7602d9703f8bcaf"",""53e9ab0db7602d97034943eb"",""56d8d62edabfae2eeecd3485""]",A pointer logic and certifying compiler,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-007-0029-9"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11704-007-0029-9""]","{""_id"":""5390ac8520f70186a0eb758b"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Frontiers of Computer Science in China"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Frontiers of Computer Science in China"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",1,2007

53e9981db7602d970203c14a,"Superpixels provide an over-segmentation representation of a natural image. However, they lack information of the entire object. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain superpixels through a merging strategy based on the bottom-up saliency values of superpixels. The proposed method aims to obtain meaningful superpixels, i.e., make the objects as complete as possible. The proposed method creates an over-segmented representation of an image. The saliency value of each superpixel is calculated through a biologically plausible saliency model in a way of statistical theory. Two adjacent superpixels are merged if the merged superpixel is more salient than the unmerged ones. The merging process is performed in an iterative way. Experimental evaluation on test images shows that the obtained saliency-based superpixels can extract the salient objects more effectively than the existing methods. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag London.","[{""_id"":""53f43b30dabfaee43ec5e998"",""bio"":null,""email"":""lfxu@uestc.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Linfeng Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Electronic Engineering,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,Chengdu,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4361c455f439fe4864b"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4d046dabfaeeee0f81860"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Liaoyuan Zeng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Electronic Engineering,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,Chengdu,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4361c455f439fe4864b"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f432b1dabfaee1c0a77e06"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhengning Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Electronic Engineering,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,Chengdu,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4361c455f439fe4864b"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11760-013-0520-8,"[""Computer vision"",""Pattern recognition"",""Salience (neuroscience"",""Computer science"",""Salient objects"",""Visual attention"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Merge (version control"",""Statistical theory"",""Multimedia information systems"",""Salient""]",,18631711,1,"[""merging strategy"",""saliency model"",""superpixel"",""visual attention""]",en,5,190,181,null,"[""557de0db6fee0fe990ca52ea"",""53e9a3b9b7602d9702cca9e1"",""53e9b86db7602d9704436c01"",""53e9ac05b7602d97035c8331"",""558a834a84ae84d265be0ca7"",""53e99b3cb7602d97023da860"",""53e9b29cb7602d9703d4283d"",""53e9b4ceb7602d9703fed433"",""53e9a6d1b7602d9703008c36"",""53e99cc9b7602d970257be34"",""53e9a7d5b7602d970311389e"",""53e9b8b3b7602d970448d966"",""53e9ad33b7602d970371729e"",""558abfe684ae84d265bf6a52"",""53e9a5f6b7602d9702f22eef"",""53e9a704b7602d9703036d7b"",""53e9afe8b7602d9703a3af5a"",""53e9b8c6b7602d97044a3514"",""53e9bcfcb7602d9704981600"",""53e9b5e0b7602d970412da0b"",""53e9a2c8b7602d9702bd0db9"",""53e9b52cb7602d970405ff52"",""53e9a7f8b7602d970313bfa7"",""5c86c6174895d9cbc697a097"",""53e9b5b6b7602d97040fbfd2"",""53e9b2e5b7602d9703d998bf"",""53e9b2dbb7602d9703d90dc7"",""53e9a5e2b7602d9702f0cd14"",""53e9a401b7602d9702d182d1"",""53e9b15ab7602d9703bdefa0"",""53e9bd59b7602d97049f2b4a"",""53e9b239b7602d9703cd6d28"",""53e9b8dab7602d97044babaf"",""53e99de2b7602d97026a5fe5"",""53e9ba2db7602d970463a139"",""53e9bdfdb7602d9704aacd0a"",""53e9b95bb7602d97045490fb""]",Saliency-based superpixels.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11760-013-0520-8"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11760-013-0520-8""]","{""_id"":""555036f27cea80f954168662"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Signal, Image and Video Processing"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",8,2014
53e9986eb7602d97020a6d90,"With the introduction of low-powered pico/femto-base stations and relay nodes into the macro-cell, recent heterogeneous networks provide an attractive approach for future wireless communication. Although it may achieve better coverage and higher capacity, several problems remain unsolved before practical deployment. For example, how to select the proper cell from neighbor low-powered cells and then occupy the radio resource without interference on macro-users is both important and challenging, especially for rigorous multimedia applications. The traditional cell access algorithms and quality-control parameters such as delay or throughput no longer suit well in this complex environment. An effective approach should be pursued. In this paper, we investigate this interesting cell association problem and propose a complete green resolution on the basis of thorough discussions about the multimedia transmission under these concerns. Cognitive radio is introduced to share spectrum between macro-cell and low-powered cells while securing the transmission of authorized macro-users. We also bring forth the concept of 'interference balance' to better manage the overall interference and energy consumption in the network. Restless bandit model is formulated on the basis of channel state, data rate, interference control, and the carefully chosen intra-refreshing rate for multimedia traffic. Then the cell association scheme is designed to be efficient and practical because of the simple index property of our model output. Simulation results have proven the performance of our proposed resolution compared with existing algorithms on interference constraint, multimedia distortion, and overall network energy consumption balance.

Inferring thematic topics from multiplex document networks requires quantifying and balancing the influence from different types of links. It is therefore a problem of considerable interest and represents significant challenges. To address this problem, we propose a novel multiplex topic model (MTM that represents the topic influence from different types of links using a factor graph. To estimate parameters in MTM, we also develop an approximate inference algorithm, multiplex belief propagation (MBP, which can estimate the influence weights of multiple links automatically at each learning iteration.

53e9983db7602d9702066578,"Signcryption is a cryptographic primitive that performs simultaneously both the functions of digital signature and public-key encryption, at a cost significantly lower than that required by the traditional signature- then-encryption approach. In this paper, we provide a positive answer to the question of if it is possible to construct signcryption based on lattice problems. More precisely, we design an efficient signcryption scheme that can send a message of length l one time. We prove that the proposed scheme has the indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks under the learning with errors assumption and strong unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the inhomogeneous small integer solution assumption in the random oracle model.

 the extant auction literature and proposes an overarching sniping agent design framework that could potentially increase the
 commercial viability of snipping agents. For better alignment between the functions of sniping agents and the needs of human
 bidders, we review existing literature based on three fundamentals: (1 knowledge about human bidder behavior, (2 awareness
 of the product(s desired by a bidder, and (3 an understanding of the research on bidding agents and auction design. The
 output of this review is the explicit consideration of iterative combinatorial auction agent design, fuzzy set representation

53e99875b7602d97020ae386,"Radio frequency identification-enabled supply chain systems are in an open system environment, where different organisations have different business workflows and operate on different standards and protocols. This supply-chain environment can only be effective if the partners can trust each other and be collaborative. However, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID involves growing privacy and security concerns in part because humans cannot sense the radio frequency radiation used to read tags and the tags themselves maintain no history of past readings. Counterfeiting in the form of cloned or fraudulent RFID tags is a consequence of a lack of security measures and trust among the partners when RFID technology is used to automate their business transactions. This paper discusses the ways in which privacy and security protection can be maintained in an open-loop RFID supply chain. A cost-based detection of counterfeit tags using different classifiers is presented. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","[{""_id"":""53f42c6fdabfaee1c0a25098"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Manmeet Mahinderjit Singh"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a5dbddabfae61d4971d9f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xue Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5486297adabfae8a11fb302c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhanhuai Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1504/IJRFITA.2011.043738,"[""Computer science"",""Computer security"",""Radio frequency"",""Supply chain management"",""Supply chain"",""Information privacy"",""Counterfeit"",""Open system (systems theory"",""Workflow"",""Radio-frequency identification""]",,17453224,4,"[""cloning"",""privacy"",""scm"",""security"",""supply chain management""]",en,5,318,294,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e99875b7602d97020ae386_0.pdf,"[""558ad18ce4b031bae1f9dc0f"",""53e9ba59b7602d97046724ae"",""53e9a958b7602d97032b21c4"",""53e9b7a6b7602d9704351be0"",""53e9a689b7602d9702fba091"",""53e99938b7602d9702178d39"",""53e9984fb7602d970208738b"",""53e9a018b7602d97028f9c4f"",""53e9a79eb7602d97030db309"",""558a459b84ae84d265bc9d8e"",""53e9b9a7b7602d970459b530"",""53e9aaa9b7602d9703427a0a"",""53e9ba0bb7602d9704610697"",""53e9a9a9b7602d9703304e82"",""558a732de4b031bae1f7b5a4"",""56d8f986dabfae2eeea9c324"",""53e9b4c3b7602d9703fe0811"",""53e9a066b7602d970294c70c"",""53e9ba59b7602d9704676189"",""53e9b4f5b7602d9704021c88"",""53e9a210b7602d9702b14b1f""]",Security and privacy protection in RFID-enabled supply chain management.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJRFITA.2011.043738""]","{""_id"":""555036e87cea80f9541662c9"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Journal of Radio Frequency Identification Technology and Applications"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IJRFITA"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",3,2011

 Internet applications the effectiveness of the port-based or payload-based identification approaches has been greatly diminished
 in recent years. And many researchers begin to turn their attentions to an alternative machine learning based method. This
 paper presents a novel machine learning-based classification model, which combines ensemble learning paradigm with co-training
 techniques. Compared to previous approaches, most of which only employed single classifier, multiple classifiers and semi-supervised
 learning are applied in our method and it mainly helps to overcome three shortcomings: limited flow accuracy rate, weak adaptability
 and huge demand of labeled training set. In this paper, statistical characteristics of IP flows are extracted from the packet
 level traces to establish the feature set, then the classification model is created and tested and the empirical results prove
 its feasibility and effectiveness.","[{""_id"":""53f469cfdabfaedf43653855"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869d86e1cd8e14a3a3125c"",""name"":""Haitao He"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Sun Yat-Sen University School of Information Science and Technology Guangzhou 510275 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2af1c455f439fe3d880"",""orgs"":[""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China"",""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Digital Life, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China"",""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Informat & Network Ctr, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5445391cdabfae862da0b35d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869d86e1cd8e14a3a3125c"",""name"":""Xiaonan Luo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Sun Yat-Sen University School of Information Science and Technology Guangzhou 510275 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2af1c455f439fe3d880"",""orgs"":[""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China"",""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Digital Life, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42f30dabfaedce54dc892"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869d86e1cd8e14a3a3125c"",""name"":""Feiteng Ma"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Sun Yat-Sen University School of Information Science and Technology Guangzhou 510275 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2af1c455f439fe3d880"",""orgs"":[""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f398b8dabfae4b34a8443a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869d86e1cd8e14a3a3125c"",""name"":""Chunhui Che"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Sun Yat-Sen University School of Information Science and Technology Guangzhou 510275 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2af1c455f439fe3d880"",""orgs"":[""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542c4825dabfae2b4e1fcc63"",""bio"":null,""email"":""lnslxn@mail.sysu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b869d86e1cd8e14a3a3125c"",""name"":""Jianmin Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Sun Yat-Sen University School of Information Science and Technology Guangzhou 510275 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2af1c455f439fe3d880"",""orgs"":[""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China"",""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Digital Life, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-009-0050-8,"[""Online machine learning"",""Stability (learning theory"",""One-class classification"",""Semi-supervised learning"",""Computer science"",""Unsupervised learning"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Linear classifier"",""Ensemble learning"",""Machine learning"",""Learning classifier system""]",,18622836,2,"[""machine learning"",""semi supervised learning"",""ensemble learning""]",en,7,346,338,null,"[""53e9af94b7602d97039dfa17"",""53e99838b7602d9702060273"",""53e9a540b7602d9702e63309"",""53e9b50ab7602d970403b385"",""53e9a1c9b7602d9702ac5339"",""53e9a034b7602d970291badf"",""53e9a8b0b7602d97031fbd4e"",""53e9a36eb7602d9702c7cac5"",""53e9aee4b7602d97039120cd"",""53e9bd24b7602d97049b2161"",""53e9b59bb7602d97040e36a9"",""558acf0084ae84d265bfc235"",""53e9ac05b7602d97035c8a73"",""53e99b71b7602d9702419c18"",""53e99d57b7602d970260fd7c"",""53e9b4afb7602d9703fc2203"",""53e9bb80b7602d97047c6fb7"",""53e9a3b3b7602d9702cc5560"",""53e9a018b7602d97028fa9c3"",""53e9b40eb7602d9703f056e1""]",Network traffic classification based on ensemble learning and co-training,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-009-0050-8"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-009-0050-8"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b77cea80f95414b7df"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Science in China Series F: Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",52,2009

53e9987db7602d97020b6e80,"The problem of distributed estimation in a wireless sensor network with unknown observation noise distribution is investigated, where each sensor only sends quantized data to a fusion center. The sensing field is modeled as a spatially random field. The objective was to accurately estimate a hidden parameter at the location where no sensor exists, while minimizing the total energy consumption. Driven by the lack of a prior knowledge of the sensing field and the existence of some outliers, an indicator kriging estimator is developed for distributed estimation under imperfect communication channels between the sensors and the fusion center. The tradeoff between estimation performance and energy consumption is formulated as an optimization problem, and a global search algorithm is proposed to approximate the solution. The results show that the proposed indicator kriging estimator achieves better performance than the inverse distance estimator and the simple averaging estimator. Moreover, the proposed search algorithm can schedule the sensors to reach the tradeoff.

53e9983db7602d9702069470,"Landmark image mining and detection have been studied for many years, however, most of the existing work focuses on their spatial attributes, while largely ignoring the temporal information in specific ones, which are taken during historical moments. This kind of images are more valuable than the normal ones as they not only contain more comprehensive information to illustrate the landmarks in different moments, but also are useful in many real world applications, such as tour recommendation and history education. In this paper, we present a novel framework named Landmark History Visualization (LHV to mine relevant and diverse images for each landmark's historic moments. There are two steps in LHV. The first one is to extract the event list of each landmark from Wikipedia. The event keywords are extracted, and some of them are automatically labeled as 3W (What, Who, When. In the second step, images searched by the landmark name are firstly collected from Flickr and Google images. Secondly, we employ manifold ranking with detected 3W to retrieve the relevant images, and lastly, an outlier detection and diversification based re-ranking approach is introduced to provide users with various returned images. We implemented our approach on 6 landmarks and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of LHV. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""53f43393dabfaec22ba65166"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Weiqing Min"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42ee8dabfaec09f1280dc"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Bing-Kun Bao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5429b185dabfaec7081a8025"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Changsheng Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_12,"[""Anomaly detection"",""Event list"",""Information retrieval"",""Temporal information"",""Computer science"",""Visualization"",""Landmark"",""History education"",""Manifold ranking""]",,16113349,2,"[""3w"",""event"",""landmark history"",""manifold ranking""]",en,0,132,121,null,"[""53e9b102b7602d9703b7c0e7"",""53e9a3e1b7602d9702cf6da9"",""53e9af00b7602d970393515f"",""53e9bad0b7602d97046ff10f"",""53e9bb8cb7602d97047d282b"",""53e9ad81b7602d9703778286"",""53e9a4c7b7602d9702de7e0c"",""53e99afeb7602d970238ca83"",""53e9b029b7602d9703a85855"",""53e9a04ab7602d97029326c3"",""53e99e04b7602d97026c471d""]",Landmark History Visualization.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_12""]","{""_id"":""53a72cac20f7420be8c4c673"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7733,2013

53e99876b7602d97020b2a98,"This paper extends the theory of corporate international investment in Choi (J. Int. Bus. Stud. 20: 145–155, 1989 in an environment where the segmentation of international capital markets for investors or the presence of agency costs
 provide some independence to corporate decisions. The model shows that the real exchange risk, the competition between firms
 in different markets and diversification gains affect corporate international investment.
 
 
 
 By accounting for the role of information as defined in the models of Merton (J. Finance 42: 483–510, 1987, Bellalah (Int. J. Finance Econ. 6: 59–67, 2001a and Bellalah and Wu (Int. J. Theor. Appl. Finance 5(5: 479–495, 2002, the model embodies different existing explanations based on economic and behavioral variables. We show in a “two-country”
 firm model that real exchange risk, diversification motives and information costs are important elements in the determination
 of corporate international investment decisions. The dynamic portfolio model reflects the main results in several theories
 of foreign direct investment. Our model accounts for the role of information in explaining foreign investments. It provides
 simple explanations which are useful in explaining the home bias puzzle in international finance.
 
 
 
 
 
 Using the dynamical programming principle method, we provide the general solution for the proportion of firm’s total capital
 budget. We also use a new method to get explicit solutions in some special cases. This new method can be applied to solve
 other financial control problems. The simulating results are given to show our conclusion and the influence of some parameters
 to the optimal solution. The economic results can be seen as a generalization of the model in Solnik (J. Econ. Theory 8: 500–524,

The correlation co-efficient (R square value approaches 0.8 and even a higher value according to the space syntax literature. In this paper, we study the same issue using the Hong Kong street network and the Hong Kong Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT datasets, and find surprisingly that street-based topological representations (or street-street topologies tend to be better representations than the axial map. In other words, vehicle flow is correlated to a morphological property of streets better than that of axial lines.

53e99866b7602d970209e411,"Relay-assisted Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ, which allows the relays instead of the source to carry out retransmissions of packets erroneously received at the destination, is an efficient cooperative transmission technique to improve link reliability with high spectrum efficiency in wireless networks. In cognitive radio (CR systems, however, this relay-assisted ARQ could induce large latency, since a successful transmission of a packet may consume two idle timeslot or temporal spectrum holes. To overcome this limitation, an active interference cancellation (IC-aided distributed relay-assisted ARQ method is proposed in this article to serve heterogeneous elastic traffics with diverse quality of service (QoS demands in CR systems. Specifically, by applying our recently proposed distributed beamforming-based IC method in the physical layer, cognitive relays can exploit spatial spectrum holes (SSHs to retransmit while keeping the interference to primary users at a tolerable level. Meanwhile, at the MAC layer, two scheduling policies, namely probabilistic and queue-length-based scheduling, are proposed to obtain an efficient allocation of temporal and SSHs to direct transmissions and retransmissions. The performance of the proposed schemes are analyzed and optimized by adjusting the scheduling parameters. As a result, the secondary users can obtain significant QoS gains, as validated by theoretical and simulation results. © 2013 Liu et al.","[{""_id"":""5601cdb945cedb3395ec17c3"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Juan Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList and Department of Electronic Engineering,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c860"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Microwave & Digital Commun, Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol TNList, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China"",""Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5440de94dabfae7f9b3583b6"",""bio"":null,""email"":""wchen@tsinghua.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Wei Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0002-9066-1448"",""org"":""State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList and Department of Electronic Engineering,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c860"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Microwave & Digital Commun, Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol TNList, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China"",""Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542dba47dabfae11fc499186"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhigang Cao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList and Department of Electronic Engineering,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c860"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Microwave & Digital Commun, Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol TNList, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China"",""Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542ac793dabfae849f6b82c6"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ying Jun (Angela Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Information Engineering,The Chinese University of Hong Kong,Shatin,Hong Kong"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2961c455f439fe3ce4d"",""orgs"":[""Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Engn, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1186/1687-1499-2013-29,"[""Hybrid automatic repeat request"",""Wireless network"",""Computer science"",""Selective Repeat ARQ"",""Single antenna interference cancellation"",""Computer network"",""Physical layer"",""Automatic repeat request"",""Spectral efficiency"",""Cognitive radio""]",,16871499,1,"[""cognitive radio"",""distributed arq"",""interference cancellation"",""markov chain"",""opportunistic scheduling""]",en,4,null,null,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e99866b7602d970209e411_0.pdf,"[""558a2e5de4b037c087559f57"",""53e9bdc7b7602d9704a78745"",""558b5445e4b0b32fcb3c0b68"",""53e9b083b7602d9703af0162"",""558a64ede4b0b32fcb368d88"",""53e9bcc1b7602d9704943730"",""53e9bb0fb7602d970474a3b6"",""558b374e84ae84d265c221bb"",""53e99d2fb7602d97025e2c45"",""573695796e3b12023e49cad5"",""53e99d28b7602d97025de337"",""53e9a781b7602d97030b9720"",""53e9bbf5b7602d970484efb7"",""53e9b0bcb7602d9703b30ada"",""53e9abf6b7602d97035b5dde"",""53e9addbb7602d97037e3a49"",""53e9b815b7602d97043cea6a"",""53e9a782b7602d97030c0438"",""558af227e4b031bae1fa9f74"",""53e9b35ab7602d9703e34856""]",Active interference cancellation-aided QoS-aware distributed ARQ for cognitive radios with heterogeneous traffics.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1687-1499-2013-29"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1186/1687-1499-2013-29"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036f27cea80f954168665"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""EURASIP J.

 arise in many applications. Treating such matrices would encounter some intricacies, especially when its (1, 1 block, i.e.,

 that leads to the so-called rigid-displacement issue. This is believed to be one of the main reasons that many programmers
 would unwillingly give up the Lagrange multiplier method but select the penalty method. Based on the Sherman–Morrison formula
 and the conventional LDLT decomposition for symmetric positive definite matrices, a robust direct solution is proposed, which is amenable to the conventional
 finite element codes, competent for both nonsingular and singular stiffness matrices, and particularly suitable to parallel
 computation. As a paradigm, the application to the element-free Galerkin method (EFGM with the moving least squares interpolation

53e99818b7602d97020340dc,"The paper investigates the question of whether a partially closed database has complete information to answer a query. In practice an enterprise often maintains master data Dm, a closed-world database. We say that a database D is partially closed if it satisfies a set V of containment constraints of the form ""q(D is a subset of p(Dm"", where q is a query in a language Lc and p is a projection query. The part of D not constrained by (Dm,V is open, from which some tuples may be missing. The database D is said to be complete for a query Q relative to (Dm,V if for all partially closed extensions D' of D, Q(D'=Q(D, i.e., adding tuples to D either violates some constraints in V or does not change the answer to Q. We first show that the proposed model can also capture the consistency of data, in addition to its relative completeness. Indeed, integrity constraints studied for consistency can be expressed as containment constraints. We then study two problems. One is to decide, given Dm, V, a query Q in a language Lq and a partially closed database D, whether D is complete for Q relative to (Dm,V. The other is to determine, given Dm, V and Q, whether there exists a partially closed database that is complete for Q relative to (Dm,V. We establish matching lower and upper bounds on these problems for a variety of languages Lq and Lc. We also provide characterizations for a database to be relatively complete, and for a query to allow a relatively complete database, when Lq and Lc are conjunctive queries.","[{""_id"":""53f4b25bdabfaee4dc8b4e8d"",""bio"":null,""email"":""wenfei@inf.ed.ac.uk"",""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9327"",""name"":""Wenfei Fan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0001-5149-2656"",""org"":""University of Edinburgh(University of Edinburgh,Edinburgh,United Kingdom"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4a31c455f439fe4b735"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Harbin, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f44543dabfaedf435c7fef"",""bio"":null,""email"":""fgeerts@inf.ed.ac.uk"",""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9327"",""name"":""Floris Geerts"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""University of Edinburgh(University of Edinburgh,Edinburgh,United Kingdom"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4a31c455f439fe4b735"",""orgs"":[""Univ Edinburgh, Sch Informat, Lab Fdn Comp Sci, Edinburgh EH8 9AB, Midlothian, Scotland""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1145/1559795.1559811,"[""Query language"",""Of the form"",""Upper and lower bounds"",""Computer science"",""Master data"",""Complete information"",""Data consistency"",""Discrete mathematics"",""Conjunctive query"",""Combinatorics"",""Existential quantification"",""Tuple"",""Algorithm"",""Data integrity"",""Completeness (statistics"",""Mathematics""]",,15574644,4,"[""satisfiability"",""master data"",""consistency"",""incomplete information"",""integrity constraints"",""complexity"",""conjunctive queries"",""information systems""]",en,49,,,null,"[""53e9a96db7602d97032c5531"",""53e9a509b7602d9702e2d52c"",""53e9a995b7602d97032f1528"",""53e9a3e1b7602d9702cf3934"",""53e9a246b7602d9702b5085d"",""53e99818b7602d97020340dc"",""53e9af88b7602d97039d16fd"",""53e99e0cb7602d97026d2966"",""53e99a2fb7602d970228cf3e"",""53e9a751b7602d9703089b26"",""53e9a24db7602d9702b5165d"",""53e99803b7602d9702015987"",""53e99dd3b7602d97026954b8"",""53e9b326b7602d9703df7c74"",""53e9b954b7602d970453dadf"",""53e9ba22b7602d9704628685"",""53e99b21b7602d97023b720f"",""53e9ad98b7602d9703794311"",""53e9b488b7602d9703f8bf91"",""53e9a208b7602d9702b0aae2"",""53e9bd2ab7602d97049b655f"",""53e9bb14b7602d970474c800"",""53e99b3cb7602d97023da35d"",""53e9b6fab7602d970428ec94"",""53e9bb14b7602d970474c7ff""]",Relative information completeness.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1862919.1862924"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1559795.1559811"",""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78650642617"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b87cea80f95414c3a9"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ACM Trans.

53e9985fb7602d9702097e20,"The aim of this paper is to present some results for the augmented Lagrangian function in the context of constrained global optimization by means of the image space analysis. It is first shown that a saddle point condition for the augmented Lagrangian function is equivalent to the existence of a regular nonlinear separation in the image space. Local and global sufficient optimality conditions for the exact augmented Lagrangian function are then investigated by means of second-order analysis in the image space. Local optimality result for this function is established under second-order sufficiency conditions in the image space. Global optimality result is further obtained under additional assumptions. Finally, it is proved that the exact augmented Lagrangian method converges to a global solution-Lagrange multiplier pair of the original problem under mild conditions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","[{""_id"":""53f433c6dabfaec09f16356e"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hzluo@zjut.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Hezhi Luo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Applied Mathematics, College of Science,Zhejiang University of Technology,Hangzhou,P.R.

Unlike local features-based methods or global template-based methods, we propose to represent a video sequence by a set of middle-level parts. A part, or component, has consistent spatial structure and consistent motion. We first segment the visual motion patterns and generate a set of middle-level components by clustering keypoints-based trajectories extracted from the video. To further exploit the interdependencies of the moving parts, we then define spatio-temporal relationships between pairwise components. The resulting descriptive middle-level components and pairwise-components thereby catch the essential motion characteristics of human activities.

53e9981db7602d970203e404,"Story understanding is one of the important branches of natural language understanding research in AI techniques. A new approach
 to story understanding is proposed in this paper. The so-called Story Parsing Grammar (SPG is used to represent the story
 abstracting processes with different degrees in story understanding, and the story understanding process is converted to the
 story recognizing process done by the syntactic parser of SPG. This kind of story understanding is called story parsing. In
 this paper, firstly, a survey of story understanding research is given. Secondly, by the classification of various kinds of
 story structures, the so-called Case Frame Forest (CFF is proposed to represent the superficial meaning of story. Based on
 CFF, a high-dimensional grammar, called Forest Grammar (FG, is defined. Furthermore, SPG is defined as a subclass of context-sensitive
 FG. Considering the context-sensitivity of story content, a type of context-sensitive derivation is defined in the definition
 of SPG. Lastly, data about runtime efficiency of the syntactic parsing algorithm of weak precedence SPG, a subclass of SPG,
 are given and analysed.","[{""_id"":""53f42e78dabfaeb22f41655a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86bf5fe1cd8e14a38b07be"",""name"":""Songmao Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""The Chinese Academy Science Institute of Mathematics 100080 Beijing"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b38a1c455f439fe43969"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/BF02939503,"[""Context-sensitive grammar"",""Syntactic parsing"",""Computer science"",""Grammar"",""Natural language understanding"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Natural language processing"",""Parsing"",""Syntax"",""Theory of computation""]",,18604749,3,"[""high-dimensional grammar"",""context-sensitive grammar."",""story understanding"",""case frame model""]",en,3,228,215,null,null,Story Parsing Grammar,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02939503"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF02939503""]","{""_id"":""555036ca7cea80f9541569a3"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""J.

In the strategy, a mathematical model aiming to minimize the total waiting times of passengers at the current stop and at the following stops is constructed and a new heuristic algorithm, shuffled complex evolution method developed at the University of Arizona (SCEUA, is adopted to optimize the holding times of early buses. Results show that the improved holding strategy can provide better performance compared with a traditional schedule-based holding strategy and no-control strategy.

53e998cdb7602d9702104f60,"This paper is concerned with the step output tracking controller design problem for networked discretetime linear systems. The communication constraints such as network-induced delay, packet disorder, and packet dropout are considered, which are treated as the round-trip time (RTT delay with an upper bound. An event-driven networked predictive control scheme is proposed to actively compensate for the RTT delay, which avoids the requirement of synchronization between the controller side and the plant side. The stability of the closed-loop system and the design procedure of the observer-based controller are discussed. A numerical example is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","[{""_id"":""53f35d69dabfae4b34977b06"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhong-Hua Pang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42c50dabfaee0d9aecc3a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guo-Ping Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Donghua Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",null,"[""Computer science"",""Controller design"",""Networked control system"",""Model predictive control"",""Control engineering"",""Real-time computing"",""Control system""]",null,18838014,6,"[""Event-driven"",""Networked control systems"",""Predictive control"",""Stability analysis"",""Step output tracking""]",en,0,817,813,null,"[""53e9ae22b7602d9703831fcd"",""558ad63f84ae84d265bfed9a"",""53e9ba32b7602d97046417cd"",""5488dce845ce147a86ddcb5a"",""53e9bd64b7602d97049fdb88"",""53e9a689b7602d9702fbaa9e"",""53e9b381b7602d9703e619d7"",""53e9be80b7602d9704b43350"",""53e99b7fb7602d9702428e5e"",""558c384ae4b00c3c48e0f36c"",""53e998f6b7602d9702133775"",""53e9a424b7602d9702d3f55e"",""53e99f86b7602d97028574a8"",""5736962d6e3b12023e53b42e""]",Step Output Tracking Controller Design for Networked Control Systems.,"[""http://www.fujipress.jp/finder/xslt.php?mode=present&inputfile=JACII001700060005.xml""]","{""_id"":""555036b87cea80f95414c3bd"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Journal of Advanced Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""JACIII"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",17,2013

53e99885b7602d97020bd4dd,"Compared to human intelligence, computers are far short of common sense knowledge which people normally acquire during the formative years of their lives. This paper investigates the effects of employing common sense knowledge as a new linguistic context in handwritten Chinese text recognition. Three methods are introduced to supplement the standard n-gram language model: embedding model, direct model, and an ensemble of these two. The embedding model uses semantic similarities from common sense knowledge to make the n-gram probabilities estimation more reliable, especially for the unseen n-grams in the training text corpus. The direct model, in turn, considers the linguistic context of the whole document to make up for the short context limit of the n-gram model. The three models are evaluated on a large unconstrained handwriting database, CASIA-HWDB, and the results show that the adoption of common sense knowledge yields improvements in recognition performance, despite the reduced concept list hereby employed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","[{""_id"":""53f43613dabfaee1c0a9af11"",""bio"":null,""email"":""wangqf@nlpr.ia.ac.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiu-Feng Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, Inst Automat, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, Inst Automat, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f48cbadabfaea88d77b490"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Erik Cambria"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0002-3030-1280"",""org"":""Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Labs, Singapore 117411, Singapore"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Natl Univ Singapore, Temasek Labs, Singapore 117411, Singapore""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54454761dabfae862da11218"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Cheng-Lin Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, Inst Automat, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, Inst Automat, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5448ed7edabfae87b7e96d61"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Amir Hussain"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0002-8080-082X"",""org"":""Univ Stirling, Dept Comp Sci & Math, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Univ Stirling, Dept Comp Sci & Math, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s12559-012-9183-y,"[""Commonsense knowledge"",""Embedding"",""Handwriting"",""Computer science"",""Human intelligence"",""Text corpus"",""Artificial intelligence"",""n-gram"",""Natural language processing"",""Language model"",""Formative assessment""]",,18669964,2,"[""Common sense knowledge"",""Natural language processing"",""Linguistic context"",""n-gram"",""Handwritten Chinese text recognition""]",en,58,242,234,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e99885b7602d97020bd4dd_0.pdf,"[""53e99ab8b7602d9702332f9c"",""56d89476dabfae2eee02fc10"",""53e99867b7602d97020a2bff"",""53e9ae62b7602d970387b6a2"",""53e9b91eb7602d970450741e"",""53e9b9fbb7602d97045fa91c"",""53e9bd76b7602d9704a182d4"",""53e9bbd5b7602d970482727a"",""53e9bcf6b7602d970497b80b"",""53e9b167b7602d9703bef7d7"",""53e9bc36b7602d97048a6a8f"",""53e998e1b7602d970211e965"",""53e9b8c7b7602d97044a72c1"",""53e9bbf5b7602d970485227c"",""53e9a946b7602d970329ca35"",""53e9b86db7602d970443869b"",""53e9bb8db7602d97047d76be"",""5c807c4d4895d9cbc6ae4821"",""53e99bf7b7602d97024a3114"",""53e9b512b7602d97040471f2"",""53e9af33b7602d970396fdc9"",""53e9bc9db7602d970491c3af"",""53e9a194b7602d9702a8782f"",""53e9b206b7602d9703c9aa39"",""53e9b430b7602d9703f2bf63"",""53e9b57cb7602d97040bed90"",""53e9b8fdb7602d97044e4388"",""53e99858b7602d9702091ebf"",""53e9b833b7602d97043ee38d"",""5583c6db0cf2b21478edda78"",""53e9ab78b7602d970351a734"",""53e9a216b7602d9702b168bd"",""53e9ba38b7602d97046469e6"",""53e99de8b7602d97026aa262"",""53e9b93fb7602d970452e1e1""]",Common Sense Knowledge for Handwritten Chinese Text Recognition.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12559-012-9183-y"",""http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s12559-012-9183-y"",""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-012-9183-y"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""53a7312920f7420be8d283e2"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Cognitive Computation"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",5,2013

Given a set of sensor nodes in Euclidean plane, our objective is to place minimum number of relay nodes to forward data packets from sensor nodes to the sink, such that: 1 the network is connected, 2 the network is 2-connected. For case one, we propose a (6 + ε-approximation algorithm for any ε > 0 with polynomial running time when ε is fixed. For case two, we propose two approximation algorithms with (24 + ε and (6/T + 12 + ε, respectively, where T is the ratio of the number of relay nodes placed in case one to the number of sensors. We further extend the results to the cases where communication radiuses of sensor nodes and relay nodes are different from each other. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.","[{""_id"":""543382c0dabfaeb4c6abcc34"",""bio"":null,""email"":""liuhai@cs.cityu.edu.hk"",""gid"":""5b869c0be1cd8e14a39922f4"",""name"":""Liu Hai"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Dept. of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4c71c455f439fe4c748"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wan Pengjun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Dept. of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, United States"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4c71c455f439fe4c748"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""548d7413dabfaed7b5fa486e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869c0be1cd8e14a39922f4"",""name"":""Jia Xiaohua"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Dept. of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4c71c455f439fe4c748"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s10878-006-7140-y,"[""Approximation algorithm"",""Key distribution in wireless sensor networks"",""Relay channel"",""Wireless network"",""Computer science"",""Computer network"",""Mobile wireless sensor network"",""Connectivity"",""Wireless sensor network"",""Relay""]",,13826905,2,"[""Approximation algorithms"",""Fault-tolerant"",""Relay node placement"",""Sensor networks""]",en,47,260,249,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e998efb7602d970212940d_0.pdf,"[""53e9b35ab7602d9703e38a53"",""53e9a57cb7602d9702ea583b"",""53e99d65b7602d9702620538"",""53e998e8b7602d9702124d9e"",""53e9a3bab7602d9702ccd984"",""53e9b6afb7602d970422eeab""]",On optimal placement of relay nodes for reliable connectivity in wireless sensor networks,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10878-006-7140-y"",""http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10878-006-7140-y"",""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10878-006-7140-y"",""https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33646532423&doi=10.1007%2fs10878-006-7140-y&partnerID=40&md5=6dcc00bf66a75c87f9dee088eed3f4bc"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""53a731ee20f7420be8d6c74a"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Journal of Combinatorial Optimization"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",11,2006

53e998efb7602d9702129f8f,"Given the dense multipath propagation in typical ultra-wideband channels, traditional coherent receivers may become computationally complex and impractical. Recently, noncoherent UWB architectures have been motivated with simple implementations. Nevertheless, the rudimentary statistical assumption and practical information uncertainty inevitably results in a hardly optimistic receiving performance. Inspired by the nature processes, in this paper we suggest a noncoherent UWB demodulator based on the particle swarm intelligence which can be realized in two steps. Firstly, a characteristic spectrum is developed from the received samples. From a novel pattern recognition perspective, four distinguishing features are extracted from this characteristic waveform to thoroughly reveal the discriminant properties of UWB multipath signals and channel noise. Subsequently, this established multidimensional feature space is compressed to a two-dimension plane by the optimal features combination technique, and UWB signal detection is consequently formulated to assign these pattern points into two classes at the minimum errors criterion. The optimal combination coefficients and the decision bound are then numerically derived by using the particle swarm optimization. Our biological noncoherent UWB receiver is independent of any explicit channel parameters, and hence is essentially robust to noise uncertainty. Numerical simulations further validate the advantages of our algorithm over the other noncoherent techniques.","[{""_id"":""53f43fcfdabfaee1c0ad9eef"",""bio"":null,""email"":""stonebupt@gmail.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Bin Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE, School of Information and Communication Engineering,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b21c455f439fe3d96f"",""orgs"":[""Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, MOE, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f7c51edabfae92b40e0fbe"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zheng Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE, School of Information and Communication Engineering,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b21c455f439fe3d96f"",""orgs"":[""Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, MOE, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4ce59dabfaeedd977bbc5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Weixia Zou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE, School of Information and Communication Engineering,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b21c455f439fe3d96f"",""orgs"":[""Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, MOE, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f438ccdabfaee43ec46ae3"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wanxin Gao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, MOE, School of Information and Communication Engineering,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b21c455f439fe3d96f"",""orgs"":[""Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, MOE, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1155/2011/341836,"[""Multipath propagation"",""Particle swarm optimization"",""Demodulation"",""Feature vector"",""Telecommunications"",""Detection theory"",""Swarm intelligence"",""Algorithm"",""Ultra-wideband"",""Detector"",""Mathematics""]",,16876180,1,"[""ultra wideband""]",en,9,null,null,null,"[""557f20c7f6678c77ea2283ad"",""53e9a0b5b7602d97029a013a"",""53e99ad7b7602d970235794c"",""557f20e3f6678c77ea2283bf"",""53e99b63b7602d9702409235"",""558aa86584ae84d265bee45d"",""53e99d96b7602d9702650ebf"",""557f20c7f6678c77ea2283ac"",""53e9bbfbb7602d9704858415"",""53e9ac70b7602d9703643123"",""53e99a6db7602d97022de7e1"",""53e9b866b7602d9704430cc8"",""53e9a051b7602d9702935cb0"",""53e99a61b7602d97022cbe57"",""53e9a81fb7602d970316907b"",""558b5582e4b031bae1fcd1e0"",""53e9bc87b7602d9704904f10"",""557f20c9f6678c77ea2283af"",""53e9a034b7602d970291ce4d""]",Particle Swarm Optimization Based Noncoherent Detector for Ultra-Wideband Radio in Intensive Multipath Environments,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2011/341836"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1155/2011/341836"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036bd7cea80f95414f305"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""EURASIP J.

53e998f0b7602d970212da7c,"In order to reduce cost and improve efficiency, many data centers adopt virtualization solutions. The advent of virtualization allows multiple virtual machines hosted on a single physical server. However, this poses new challenges for resource management. Web workloads which are dominant in data centers are known to vary dynamically with time. In order to meet application's service level agreement (SLA, how to allocate resources for virtual machines has become an important challenge in virtualized server environments, especially when dealing with fluctuating workloads and complex server applications. User experience is an important manifestation of SLA and attracts more attention. In this paper, the SLA is defined by server-side response time. Traditional resource allocation based on resource utilization has some drawbacks. We argue that dynamic resource allocation directly based on real-time user experience is more reasonable and also has practical significance. To address the problem, we propose a system architecture that combines response time measurements and analysis of user experience for resource allocation. An optimization model is introduced to dynamically allocate the resources among virtual machines. When resources are insufficient, we provide service differentiation and firstly guarantee resource requirements of applications that have higher priorities. We evaluate our proposal using TPC-W and Webbench. The experimental results show that our system can judiciously allocate system resources. The system helps stabilize applications' user experience.

53e998a3b7602d97020dd26f,"Due to the massive explosion of multimedia content on the web, users demand a new type of information retrieval, called cross-modal multimedia retrieval where users submit queries of one media type and get results of various other media types. Performing effective retrieval of heterogeneous multimedia content brings new challenges. One essential aspect of these challenges is to learn a heterogeneous metric between different types of multimedia objects. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian personalized ranking based heterogeneous metric learning (BPRHML algorithm, which optimizes for correctly ranking the retrieval results. It uses pairwise preference constraints as training data and explicitly optimizes for preserving these constraints. To further encouraging the smoothness of learning results, we integrate graph regularization with Bayesian personalized ranking.

53e998e1b7602d970211c2ce,"The exploitation of renewable resources creates many complex problems for culture, ecology and economics as well. Ascertaining
 the essentials behind the complex problems is very important. In this paper, we mainly study various complex relations appearing
 in the optimal exploitation process for renewable resources. First, we derive a sufficient condition on the existence of optimal
 harvesting policies for one-species population resources. Then we present every possible optimal harvesting pattern for such
 a model. On the basis of this, we give a computing formula for estimating the optimal harvesting period, optimal transitional
 period, and optimal recruitment period. The main difference with respect to the previous works in literature is that our optimal
 harvesting policy is a piece-wise continuous function of time t, at the piecewise point t
 
 c
 , which is called switching time. At the switching time we switch the harvesting rate from h to some transitional control u
 ∗, then to 0. Clearly this kind of harvesting policy is easier to carry out than those by others, provided that there exists
 a managing department which can highly supervise the resources.","[{""_id"":""53f43370dabfaedd74d82361"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86c707e1cd8e14a3c19b16"",""name"":""Haiying Jing"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern University Department of Applied Mathematics Shenyang 110004 China Shenyang 110004 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c91c455f439fe3e3e5"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45015dabfaeee22a1c81d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868e2de1cd8e14a33dd295"",""name"":""Zhaoyu Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shenyang Architectural and Civil Engineering Institute Department of Management Shenyang 110004 China Shenyang 110004 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11424-006-0517-2,"[""Complex system"",""Continuous function"",""Population"",""Switching time"",""Mathematical optimization"",""Existential quantification"",""Computer science"",""Renewable resource"",""Piecewise"",""Computation""]",,15597067,4,"[""optimal switching time"",""optimal harvesting patterns"",""complexity"",""optimal transitional period."",""optimal transitional period"",""optimal harvesting period"",""Complexity""]",en,0,526,517,null,null,Complexity Analysis and Computation of the Optimal Harvesting for One-Species Population Resources.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11424-006-0517-2"",""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11424-006-0517-2""]","{""_id"":""555036ef7cea80f954166eac"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""J.

53e998e9b7602d97021279b0,"Systems with heavy workloads run many queries concurrently. Modern database workloads-as those incurred by business intelligence applications-involve ad-hoc, highly complex, expensive queries. While query plans are optimized individually, the workload overall is not. Plans running together incur resource contention, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this, we introduce the idea of alternative-objective query optimization. Multiple query plans for the same query are generated, each optimized for an alternative resource usage. At runtime, the workload manager then can choose the plan for the query that works best for runtime conditions. This balances the system load, reducing contention, to increase overall workload throughput. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","[{""_id"":""53f467b2dabfaec09f244df4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zahid Abul-Basher"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5602185245cedb3395f09c03"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yi Feng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""544823e8dabfae87b7ddfe75"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Parke Godfrey"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""562c9b2f45cedb3398c74749"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaohui Yu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f39900dabfae4b34a86310"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Mokhtar Kandil"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42f7ddabfaeb2ac0049ef"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Daniel C.

A multiple power constrained non-convex optimization problem is formulated by using the minimum-mean-squared error (MMSE criterion. We decompose the original problem into two sub-problems. The relay transceiver Wiener filter structure is first rigorously derived, then the source transmit and destination receive matrices are jointly designed by solving an equivalent dual problem. Through our proposed joint iterative algorithm, the closed-form solutions can be finally obtained. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated by simulations with comparison to some of the existing schemes.

53e998a9b7602d97020e0377,"We present a verifiable low-level program representation to embed, propagate, and preserve safety information in high perfor-mance compilers for safe languages such as Java and C#. Our representation precisely encodes safety information via static single-assignment (SSA [11, 3] proof variables that are first-class constructs in the program.We argue that our representation allows a compiler to both (1 express aggressively optimized machine-independent code and (2 leverage existing compiler infrastructure to preserve safety information during optimization. We demonstrate that this approach supports standard compiler optimizations, requires minimal changes to the implementation of those optimizations, and does not artificially impede those optimizations to preserve safety. We also describe a simple type system that formalizes type safety in an SSA-style control-flow graph program representation. Through the types of proof variables, our system enables compositional verification of memory safety in optimized code. Finally, we discuss experiences integrating this representation into the machine-independent global optimizer of STARJIT, a high-performance just-in-time compiler that performs aggressive control-flow, data-flow, and algebraic optimizations and is competitive with top production systems.","[{""_id"":""53f4370bdabfaee0d9b6a8cd"",""bio"":null,""email"":""vijay.s.menon@intel.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Vijay Menon"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f3ade9dabfae4b34b0913d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86c098e1cd8e14a393b3ba"",""name"":""Neal Glew"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Intel Labs"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2821c455f439fe3c5f6"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f474d0dabfaec09f277fbe"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86c59fe1cd8e14a3b77900"",""name"":""Brian R.

53e998c0b7602d97020fbf31,"This paper investigates an uncapacitated multi-product production planning problem with returned product remanufacturing and
 demand substitution, where no backlog and no disposal are allowed. Both the production of new products and the remanufacturing
 of returned products are considered to meet time-varying demands in a finite time horizon. Setup costs are taken into account
 when a new product is manufactured or a returned product is remanufactured. The problem is to determine when and how many
 returned products are remanufactured and new products are manufactured so as to minimize the total cost, including manufacturing,
 remanufacturing, holding and substitution costs. We first develop an optimization model to formulate the problem. We then
 propose a dynamic programming approach to derive the optimal solution in the case with large quantities of returned products.
 We further propose an approximate approach for the general problem to compute a near-optimal solution. The proposed approaches
 are evaluated by computational experiments and the effectiveness of the approximate approach is verified. Some managerial
 insights regarding the effects of remanufacturing/substitution are also obtained from the computational studies.","[{""_id"":""542a9ed4dabfae646d578829"",""bio"":null,""email"":""liyongjian@em.tsinghua.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86abd0e1cd8e14a30056ac"",""name"":""Yongjian Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management Beijing 100084 People’s Republic of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4891c455f439fe4aafc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""56cb18acc35f4f3c6565a9a7"",""bio"":null,""email"":""chenj@em.tsinghua.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86abd0e1cd8e14a30056ac"",""name"":""Jian Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management Beijing 100084 People’s Republic of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4891c455f439fe4aafc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f79360dabfae8faa49b05f"",""bio"":null,""email"":""xqcai@se.cuhk.edu.hk"",""gid"":""5b86b945e1cd8e14a35ed21c"",""name"":""Xiaoqiang Cai"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""The Chinese University of HongKong Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management Shatin N.

Frequency-domain analysis and algebra graph theory are employed to derive the sufficient and necessary condition guaranteeing the second-order delayed multi-agent system applying the consensus protocol with the delayed-state-derivative feedback to achieve the stationary consensus asymptotically. It is proved that introducing delayed-state-derivative feedback with the proper intensity can improve the robustness against communication delay and that for two particular kinds of second-order delayed multi-agent systems, introducing the delayed-state-derivative feedback can also accelerate the convergence speed, provided that the intensity of the delayed-state-derivative feedback is chosen properly.

53e998bfb7602d97020fa138,"This paper reviews recent advances in fully printed chipless radio frequency identification (RFID technology with special concern on the discussion of coding theories, ID generating circuits, and tag antennas. Two types of chipless tags, one based on time-domain reflections and the other based on frequency domain signatures, are introduced. To enable a fully printed encoding circuit, linearly tapering technique is adopted in the first type of tags to cope with parasitic resistances of printed conductors. Both simulation and measurement efforts are made to verify the feasibility of the eight-bit fully printed paper-based tag. In the second type of tags, a group of LC tanks are exploited for encoding data in frequency domain with their resonances. The field measurements of the proof-of-concept of the tag produced by toner-transferring process and flexible printed circuit boards are provided to validate the practicability of the reconfigurable ten-bit chipless RFID tag. Furthermore, a novel RFID tag antenna design adopting linearly tapering technique is introduced. It shows 40 % save of conductive ink materials while keeping the same performance for conventional half-wave dipole antennas and meander line antennas. Finally, the paper discusses the future trends of chipless RFID tags in terms of fabrication cost, coding capacity, size, and reconfigurability. We see that, coupled with revolutionary design of low-cost tag antennas, fabrication/reconfiguration by printing techniques, moving to higher frequencies to shrink tag sizes and reduce manufacturing cost, as well as innovation in ID generating circuits to increase coding capacities, will be important research topics towards item-level tracking applications of chipless RFID tags. © 2013 Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer-Verlag France.","[{""_id"":""53f438a9dabfaedce55444dc"",""bio"":null,""email"":""botao@kth.se"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Botao Shao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""iPack Center & ES Unit,KTH (Royal Institute of Technology,Stockholm,Sweden"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2831c455f439fe3c66b"",""orgs"":[""KTH Royal Inst Technol, iPack Ctr, S-16440 Stockholm, Sweden"",""KTH Royal Inst Technol, ES Unit, S-16440 Stockholm, Sweden"",""Fudan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5440ae8ddabfae805a6e4f1a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiang Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""iPack Center & ES Unit,KTH (Royal Institute of Technology,Stockholm,Sweden"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2831c455f439fe3c66b"",""orgs"":[""KTH Royal Inst Technol, iPack Ctr, S-16440 Stockholm, Sweden"",""KTH Royal Inst Technol, ES Unit, S-16440 Stockholm, Sweden""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4592adabfaec09f210954"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yasar Amin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0003-4968-993X"",""org"":""iPack Center & ES Unit,KTH (Royal Institute of Technology,Stockholm,Sweden"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2831c455f439fe3c66b"",""orgs"":[""KTH Royal Inst Technol, iPack Ctr, S-16440 Stockholm, Sweden"",""KTH Royal Inst Technol, ES Unit, S-16440 Stockholm, Sweden""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42e4ddabfaedce54d15b3"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ran Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Information Science and Engineering,Fudan University,Shanghai,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c861"",""orgs"":[""Fudan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f7e1d3dabfae938c6e6dfd"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Li-Rong Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""iPack Center & ES Unit,KTH (Royal Institute of Technology,Stockholm,Sweden"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2831c455f439fe3c66b"",""orgs"":[""KTH Royal Inst Technol, iPack Ctr, S-16440 Stockholm, Sweden"",""KTH Royal Inst Technol, ES Unit, S-16440 Stockholm, Sweden"",""Fudan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s12243-013-0378-3,"[""LC circuit"",""Dipole antenna"",""Chipless RFID"",""Reconfigurability"",""Electronic engineering"",""Flexible electronics"",""Conductive ink"",""Engineering"",""Electronic circuit"",""Radio-frequency identification"",""Electrical engineering""]",,19589395,78,"[""chipless rfid"",""frequency resonance"",""fully printing"",""lc tank"",""linearly tapering"",""paper substrate"",""time-domain reflections"",""telecommunications""]",en,16,413,401,null,"[""53e9a424b7602d9702d4197a"",""53e9985fb7602d970209bdf2"",""53e9b40eb7602d9703f04c31"",""53e9ae17b7602d9703825436"",""53e9b754b7602d97042f4570"",""56d81428dabfae2eee663540""]",Chipless RFID tags fabricated by fully printing of metallic inks.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12243-013-0378-3"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12243-013-0378-3"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036bd7cea80f95414f30d"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Annales des Télécommunications"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",68,2013

MKL is used to learn an optimal combination of χ2 kernels and Gaussian kernels, each type of which captures a different feature. Our features include the color information and spatial pyramid histogram (SPH based on global spatial correspondence of the geometric distribution of visual words. We propose a simple effective way for on-line updating MKL classifier, where useful tracking objects are automatically selected as support vectors. The algorithm handle target appearance variation, and makes better usage of history information, which leads to better discrimination of target and the surrounding background. The experiments on real world sequences demonstrate that our method can track objects accurately and robustly especially under partial occlusion and large appearance change.","[{""_id"":""542aa7eadabfae646d57cc03"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b0cde1cd8e14a32191d9"",""name"":""Huchuan Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e34f"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4566ddabfaeb22f501308"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b0cde1cd8e14a32191d9"",""name"":""Wenling Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e34f"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""548570badabfaed7b5fa21c4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b531e1cd8e14a3414095"",""name"":""Yen-Wei Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""College of Information Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2a21c455f439fe3d385"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-19318-7_40,"[""Computer vision"",""Histogram"",""Pattern recognition"",""Kernel embedding of distributions"",""Multiple kernel learning"",""Video tracking"",""Eye tracking"",""Pyramid"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Classifier (linguistics"",""Mathematics"",""Visual Word""]",,16113349,3,"[""better usage"",""better discrimination"",""multiple kernel"",""object tracking"",""history information"",""color information"",""large appearance change"",""spatial pyramid histogram"",""target appearance variation"",""feature combination"",""mkl classifier"",""new method"",""global spatial correspondence"",""geometric distribution"",""support vector"",""gaussian kernel""]",en,12,522,511,null,"[""53e9b7e1b7602d9704391204"",""53e99cafb7602d9702563b52"",""558ac92ee4b0b32fcb38db19"",""53e9a06db7602d97029543eb"",""53e9a58bb7602d9702eb3c44"",""53e9b002b7602d9703a5aa2e"",""53e9ad05b7602d97036e4450"",""558a7457e4b031bae1f7bcb8"",""53e9aad2b7602d9703452f94"",""53e9bddbb7602d9704a8f03a"",""53e9a515b7602d9702e39c23"",""53e99c92b7602d9702546537"",""558a48c8e4b031bae1f6bac9"",""53e99c43b7602d97024f09da"",""53e9b2f4b7602d9703db1688"",""558aaed7e4b031bae1f90fb6"",""53e9b839b7602d97043f6706"",""53e9b5bcb7602d970410705f"",""53e9a5a1b7602d9702ec8551"",""53e99cc2b7602d9702578567"",""53e9984bb7602d970207c373"",""53e9a97bb7602d97032d44f8""]",On feature combination and multiple kernel learning for object tracking,"[""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79952520472""]","{""_id"":""54824c66582fc50b5e008eb0"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Asian Conference on Computer Vision"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",6494,2011

53e998dbb7602d9702116290,"The multi-leader-follower game can be looked on as a generalization of the Nash equilibrium problem and the Stackelberg game, which contains several leaders and a number of followers. Recently, the multi-leader-follower game has been drawing more and more attention, for example, in electricity power markets. However, when we formulate a general multi-leader-follower game as a single-level game, it will give rise to a lot of problems, such as the lack of convexity and the failure of constraint qualifications. In this paper, to get rid of these difficulties, we focus on a class of multi-leader-follower games that satisfy some particular, but still reasonable assumptions, and show that these games can be formulated as ordinary Nash equilibrium problems, and then as variational inequalities. We establish some results on the existence and uniqueness of a leader-follower Nash equilibrium. We also present illustrative numerical examples from an electricity power market model. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","[{""_id"":""53f556bbdabfaea7cd1d619d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ming Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Mathematics and Physics,Jiangsu University of Science and Technology,Zhenjiang,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2be1c455f439fe3dee7"",""orgs"":[""Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Dept Appl Math & Phys, Kyoto 6068501, Japan"",""Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Math & Phys, Zhenjiang 212003, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43139dabfaee1c0a655c5"",""bio"":null,""email"":""fuku@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Masao Fukushima"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0002-4372-6376"",""org"":""Department of Applied Mathematics and Physics, Graduate School of Informatics,Kyoto University,Kyoto,Japan"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2901c455f439fe3cb6c"",""orgs"":[""Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Dept Appl Math & Phys, Kyoto 6068501, Japan""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s10957-011-9901-8,"[""Mathematical economics"",""Mathematical optimization"",""Epsilon-equilibrium"",""Best response"",""Equilibrium selection"",""Repeated game"",""Game theory"",""Solution concept"",""Normal-form game"",""Nash equilibrium"",""Mathematics""]",,15732878,3,"[""deregulated electricity market model"",""multi-leader-follower game"",""nash equilibrium problem"",""variational inequality""]",en,5,473,455,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e998dbb7602d9702116290_0.pdf,"[""53e9afbab7602d9703a0c2da"",""573695696e3b12023e48edb7"",""53e9b6d6b7602d9704264d01"",""573696806e3b12023e58c50c"",""53e9b8aeb7602d970448ac8d"",""53e9ac89b7602d9703660a57"",""53e9a930b7602d9703280a4b"",""53e99aa6b7602d9702321d49"",""5736968d6e3b12023e597e4f"",""53e9badeb7602d970470b143""]",Variational Inequality Formulation of a Class of Multi-Leader-Follower Games.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10957-011-9901-8"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10957-011-9901-8"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036d27cea80f95415a4e1"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""J.

53e998dbb7602d970211715c,"In modern cryptographic systems, physical unclonable functions (PUFs are efficient mechanisms for many security applications, which extract intrinsic random physical variations to generate secret keys. The classical PUFs mainly exhibit static challenge-response behaviors and generate static keys, while many practical cryptographic systems need reconfigurable PUFs which allow dynamic keys derived from the same circuit. In this paper, the concept of reconfigurable multi-port PUFs (RMPUFs is proposed. RM-PUFs not only allow updating the keys without physically replacement, but also generate multiple keys from different ports in one clock cycle. A practical RM-PUFs construction is designed based on asynchronous clock and fabricated in TSMC low-power 65 nm CMOS process. The area of test chip is 1.1mm2, and the maximum clock frequency is 0.8 GHz at 1.2V. The average power consumption is 27.6mW at 27°C. Finally, test results show that the RM-PUFs generate four reconfigurable 128-bit secret keys, and the keys are secure and reliable over a range of environmental variations such as supply voltage and temperature.

53e998b8b7602d97020f483a,"Integrins may undergo large conformational changes during activation, but the dynamic processes and pathways remain poorly understood. We used molecular dynamics to simulate forced unbending of a complete integrin αVβ3 ectodomain in both unliganded and liganded forms. Pulling the head of the integrin readily induced changes in the integrin from a bent to an extended conformation. Pulling at a cyclic RGD ligand bound to the integrin head also extended the integrin, suggesting that force can activate integrins. Interactions at the interfaces between the hybrid and β tail domains and between the hybrid and epidermal growth factor 4 domains formed the major energy barrier along the unbending pathway, which could be overcome spontaneously in ~1 μs to yield a partially-extended conformation that tended to rebend. By comparison, a fully-extended conformation was stable. A newly-formed coordination between the αV Asp457 and the α-genu metal ion might contribute to the stability of the fully-extended conformation. These results reveal the dynamic processes and pathways of integrin conformational changes with atomic details and provide new insights into the structural mechanisms of integrin activation. © 2011 Chen et al.","[{""_id"":""542a9a05dabfae2b4e11f423"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wei Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f431fedabfaee4dc75405d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jizhong Lou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4cd8ddabfaeed21f80ed7"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jen Hsin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5487fc00dabfae8a11fb3fb7"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Klaus Schulten"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""543344d9dabfaeb54218202b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Stephen C.

53e998f0b7602d970212b7d1,"Mobile health services have become increasingly important for people, especially for the elderly. Despite the potential benefits, there are challenges and barriers for the elderly in adopting mobile health services. Drawing upon the dual factor model, we investigate the enablers and the inhibitors of the elderly mobile health service adoption behaviour. We also address two typical characteristics of elderly users - technology anxiety and dispositional resistance to change - to understand the antecedents of the enablers and the inhibitors. The hypothesized model is empirically tested using data collected from a field survey of 204 customers of a large elderly service providing company in China. The key findings include: (1 resistance to change influences perceived usefulness but does not influence perceived ease of use and adoption intention; (2 technology anxiety is negatively associated with perceived ease of use but positively associated with resistance to change; (3 dispositional resistance to change is negatively associated with perceived ease of use but positively associated with resistance to change. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2012 Institute of Information Management, University of St. Gallen.","[{""_id"":""53f4533adabfaee43ecb0a6d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xitong Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Management,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa1beadabfae7f97b08d94"",""bio"":null,""email"":""sunyq1982@gmail.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Yongqiang Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0001-8753-9268"",""org"":""School of Information Management,Wuhan University,Wuhan,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2cf1c455f439fe3e6ee"",""orgs"":[""Wuhan Univ, Sch Informat Management, 299 Bayi Rd, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54407b12dabfae805a6c3990"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Nan Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""USTC-CityU Joint Advanced Research Center,University of Science and Technology of China,Suzhou,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e380"",""orgs"":[""Univ Sci & Technol China, USTC CityU Joint Adv Res Ctr, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f432a1dabfaedf4355900d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jerry Zeyu Peng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Business,East China University of Science and Technology,Shanghai,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e37c"",""orgs"":[""E China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43b44dabfaedf435aecf2"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ziyu Yan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Faculty of Business, Information Systems Department,City University of Hong Kong,Kowloon,Hong Kong SAR"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4c71c455f439fe4c748"",""orgs"":[""City Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business, Dept Informat Syst, Kowloon 310027, Hong Kong, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s12525-012-0112-4,"[""Great Rift"",""Field survey"",""China"",""Anxiety"",""Usability"",""Technology acceptance model"",""Psychology"",""Health services"",""Negatively associated"",""Marketing""]",,14228890,1,"[""dual factor model"",""keyword: preventive mobile health services"",""resistance to change"",""technology acceptance model"",""technology anxiety""]",en,73,61,49,null,"[""53e9be09b7602d9704abeacd"",""53e9b6cbb7602d97042564b1"",""53e9a0cab7602d97029b5f10"",""53e9bd50b7602d97049e4efe"",""53e9bb61b7602d970479fd19"",""53e9a7ffb7602d9703142e86"",""53e9b3e2b7602d9703ed1ec3"",""53e9a58cb7602d9702eb783a"",""53e9a130b7602d9702a1f076"",""53e9b2d2b7602d9703d80897"",""53e99808b7602d970201c4b1"",""53e99c91b7602d97025424f1"",""53e9be80b7602d9704b411b6"",""53e9b5fab7602d970414f326"",""53e9a8eab7602d970323912a"",""53e99b86b7602d970242a5eb"",""53e9b166b7602d9703bed4fb"",""53e9a86ab7602d97031b9320"",""55a4f40cc91bf3b1cc4afc03"",""53e99c58b7602d9702506e42"",""53e99ea6b7602d970276df8a""]",The dark side of elderly acceptance of preventive mobile health services in China.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12525-012-0112-4"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12525-012-0112-4"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""5482517d582fc50b5e0426de"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Electronic Markets"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",23,2013

The traditional online friend recommendation methods usually focus on the shared interests, topics or social network links, but neglect the more and more important geographic information. In this paper, we focus on users' geographic trajectories that consisting of a series of positions in time order. We reduce the length of each trajectory by clustering the points and normalize every trajectory according to its positions and time in the trajectory. The similarity between trajectories is computed based on the distance of each corresponding point pair in the respective trajectory and the trajectories' trends. The potential online friends are recommended based on the trajectory similarity and social network structures.

 used. Fuzzy clustering is sensitive to noises and possibilistic clustering is sensitive to the initialization of cluster centers

 fuzzy leader (PFL clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper to overcome these shortcomings. Considering the advantages
 of the leader algorithm in time efficiency and the initialization of cluster, the framework of the leader algorithm is used.
 In addition, a λ-cut set is defined to process the overlapping clusters adaptively. The comparison of experimental results shows that our
 proposed algorithm is valid, efficient, and has better accuracy.

This approach not only substantially reduces the computational complexity via real-valued decomposition, but also outperforms the forward backward spatial smoothing algorithm for uncorrelated or correlated sources. In addition, this method allows to select desired signals and to ignore interferences because of its signal-selective property. The performance analysis shows that for uncorrelated or correlated sources, the Hermitian mapping approach has a lower RMSE and a higher output SNR than the FBSS method.

53e9989bb7602d97020d2756,"The real-world applications to massive data processing raise two huge challenges to the traditional supervised machine learning. First, the sufficient training examples to ensure the generalization ability become unavailable, since the task of labeling examples by experts is time-consuming and expensive; second, it is impossible to load massive data into memory, and the response time is unacceptable for training and classifying the massive data by a traditional serial mode. In this paper, we gracefully combine the semi-supervised learning with the parallel computing technique to meet these two challenges together. In detail, (1 the co-training style semi-supervised learning named Tri-training is exploited and revised in order to perform learning from the limited amount of labeled data and the large amount of unlabeled data. In particular, the co-training process of Tri-training approach is revised by introducing a data editing operation to remove the newly mislabeled data before it is used to re-train another classifier. Since the data editing can effectively remedy the unavoidable mislabeling problem in co-training style algorithms, the generalization ability of the learned hypothesis can be improved. (2 Furthermore, the learning algorithm for each individual classifier and the data editing operation in the Tri-training are re-formed as the Google's MapReduce parallel pattern instead of the traditional memory-resident and serial mode. The MapReduce pattern ensures that each co-training iteration and predicting process in Tri-training could be implemented in parallel on the clusters of commodity PCs. The experiment results on UCI datasets show the improvement of our revised Tri-training over the accuracy, even if it performs learning only with the limited amount of labeled data. The real application to detect the small pulmonary nodes in CT chest images also proves that our revised Tri-training algorithm can effectively reduce the false negative rate and the false positive rate. As well as, the application proves the scalability to massive data due to the adaptation to the MapReduce parallel paradigm.","[{""_id"":""5405b0afdabfae44f0821952"",""bio"":null,""email"":""maozuguo@hit.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86b6c6e1cd8e14a34cc41f"",""name"":""Mao-Zu Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Computer Science and Technology|Harbin Institute of Technology"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46d52dabfaee4dc869b9e"",""bio"":null,""email"":""dengchao@hit.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86b6c6e1cd8e14a34cc41f"",""name"":""Chao Deng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Computer Science and Technology|Harbin Institute of Technology"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c6e1cd8e14a34cc41f"",""name"":""Yang Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Computer Science and Technology|Harbin Institute of Technology"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5429ea4cdabfaec7081c9a0f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86a73ee1cd8e14a3e296d2"",""name"":""Ping Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Radiology Department|Affiliated Hospital|Harbin Medical University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4771c455f439fe4a291"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1080/03081079.2010.544866,"[""Online machine learning"",""Data mining"",""Stability (learning theory"",""Instance-based learning"",""Semi-supervised learning"",""Active learning (machine learning"",""Computer science"",""Supervised learning"",""Unsupervised learning"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Machine learning"",""Learning classifier system""]",,15635104,4,"[""supervised learning"",""parallel computer"",""machine learning"",""semi supervised learning""]",en,1,,,null,"[""53e9ad18b7602d97036f6d9e"",""53e99a85b7602d97022f8651"",""53e9980eb7602d970202698a"",""53e9ac21b7602d97035e006b"",""53e99ad7b7602d970235bf16"",""53e9a80cb7602d970314c407"",""53e9a034b7602d97029186bf"",""53e9bdfdb7602d9704aacecf"",""53e9a4f3b7602d9702e15e5b"",""53e99f27b7602d97027f16af"",""53e9b5a2b7602d97040ea17f"",""53e9adcdb7602d97037d7a8b"",""53e99a98b7602d970230eced"",""53e9bb52b7602d9704790954"",""53e99a8cb7602d9702300591"",""53e9b556b7602d970408cb51"",""53e99b71b7602d9702419c18"",""53e99c12b7602d97024c20b9"",""53e9bb80b7602d97047c6fb7"",""53e9af87b7602d97039cd9fb"",""53e9af67b7602d97039a9d49"",""53e997ddb7602d9701fd4ad0""]",Tri-training and MapReduce based Massive Data Learning,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03081079.2010.544866"",""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79952693191""]","{""_id"":""53a72f8120f7420be8cadc2a"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Journal of General Systems"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Int.

53e998a3b7602d97020db3e4,"With the popular use of service-oriented technologies, Database as a Service(DaaS paradigm is becoming a more practical and useful model for those enterprises who can't afford the expensive DBMS products. However, access control management by the database service provider(DSP in this paradigm is challenged because the DSP may be untrusted for the delegated data contents. So it is important to design an access control mechanism which can couple with the delegated encrypted database to efficiently improve the usability of the system and help to prevent theft of sensitive and critical data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to implement flexible access control enforcement management by designing a DSP re-encryption mechanism. Our approach not only can implement the selective authorization on the encrypted data, but also can relieve the client users from the complex key derivation procedure. The underlying idea of our approach is that the DSP uses different re-encryption keys for users of the system to implement flexible access control enforcement management under the DSP re-encryption mechanism. We demonstrate the efficiency and security of our flexible access control enforcement management, in the end we analyze and resolve the possible attacks and information disclosure.","[{""_id"":""53f466a8dabfaec09f240b7a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""XiuXia Tian"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54488f3ddabfae87b7e43278"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaoling Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4a1e9dabfaec3b677b402"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Aoying Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",null,"[""Key derivation function"",""Digital signal processing"",""Computer security"",""Computer science"",""Usability"",""Authorization"",""Encryption"",""Service provider"",""Access control"",""Enforcement""]",null,18163548,1,"[""Access control enforcement"",""DaaS"",""DSP re-encryption mechanism"",""Selective authorization""]",en,0,41,28,,"[""53e9aa10b7602d970337f162"",""53e9b098b7602d9703b00038"",""53e99b94b7602d9702439f10"",""53e9ab07b7602d970348b241"",""53e9a1a8b7602d9702a9a22b"",""53e998bfb7602d97020f88cb"",""53e9b055b7602d9703abc218"",""53e9b62db7602d9704184e99"",""53e9ba05b7602d97046089a7"",""53e9b11db7602d9703b9ab51"",""53e9a455b7602d9702d738a3"",""53e9b4a0b7602d9703fab6ad"",""53e9a982b7602d97032de817"",""53e9ab69b7602d9703506dd4"",""53e9b5edb7602d970413e50d"",""5c8bb5ab4895d9cbc6a531d7"",""53e9b910b7602d97044f71ae"",""5c77fbff4895d9cbc66ea41e"",""53e9ae84b7602d97038a160f"",""53e99ddbb7602d970269c02e"",""53e99eaeb7602d97027758fb"",""53e9bc15b7602d970487a555"",""53e9a8b7b7602d9703206880"",""53e9a14cb7602d9702a3da9d"",""53e9b9e7b7602d97045e1a7d""]",DSP Re-encryption Based Access Control Enforcement Management Mechanism in DaaS.,"[""http://ijns.femto.com.tw/contents/ijns-v15-n1/ijns-2013-v15-n1-p28-41.pdf""]","{""_id"":""555036e47cea80f954164b11"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Journal of Network Security"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""I.

 many times, it is slow. In this paper, we present a more efficient algorithm for seam based content-aware image resizing,

 to find the optimal matches within a weighted bipartite graph composed of the pixels in adjacent rows or columns. Therefore,
 our method is fast (e.g. our method needs only about 100 ms to reduce a 768 × 1024 image’s width to 1/3 while Avidan and Shamir’s
 method needs 12 s. This supports immediate image resizing whereas Avidan and Shamir’s method requires a more costly pre-processing

It is designed to carry out the reliable and undetectable transmission. In this paper, a simple and secure covert timing channel method with distribution matching is proposed. The approach treats the network traffic as the flow with the fixed-length fragment, and calculates the histogram of the packet delays in each fragment. The message bits are modulated into the delays by the binary coding method, and the histogram is kept almost unchanged by assigning the matched distribution. The bit error rates are analyzed and two detection experiments are performed.

53e99905b7602d97021434ba,"In large-scale distributed simulation, thousands of objects keep moving and interacting in a virtual environment, which produces a mass of messages. High level architecture (HLA is the prevailing stan- dard for modeling and simulation. It specifies two publish-subscribe mechanisms for message filtering: class-based and value-based. However, the two mechanisms can only judge whether a message is relevant to a subscriber or not. Lacking of the ability to evaluate the relevance, all relevant messages are delivered with the same priority even when congestion occurs. It significantly limits the scalability and performance of distributed simulation. Aiming to solve the relevance evaluation problem, speed up message filtering, and filter more unnecessary messages, a new relevance evaluation mechanism Layer of Interest (LoI was proposed by this paper. LoI defines a relevance classifier based on the impact of spatial distance on receiving attributes and attribute values. An adaptive publish-subscribe scheme was built on the basis of LoI. This scheme can abandon most irrelevant messages directly. Run-time infrastructure (RTI can also apply congestion control by reducing the frequency of sending or receiving object messages based on each objects’ LoI.

53e99953b7602d9702196194,"The content created by the users of social networking sites has reached such high levels of quality and variety that it is comparable to that produced by professional agencies. Therefore, understanding what types of content users generate and the underlying motivational factors is vital to the success of the sites. The extant research on content generation has primarily focused on the amount of content and on how to encourage participation in content creation, and less attention has been paid to the content itself and how social relations affect the types of content that users upload. This study aims to empirically document the relationship between social ties and the similarities between the types of content that people create online. We collected a large data set from the photo-hosting website Flickr detailing the users' social relations over time in conjunction with their photo-uploading behavior. We found that around the time of the formation of a social tie, members of dyads began to upload more similar photos than they did before that time. After a social tie was formed, this similarity evolved in different ways in different subgroups of dyads. Whereas the similarity between photos uploaded by dyads experiencing notably different popularity levels on the site continued to grow, the dyads of users with similar levels of popularity gradually began to upload less similar photos. In cultural production, individuals appear to present themselves as unique; this feature is more salient when the social contacts are similar in popularity status. Photo-shooting behaviors have been found to exhibit the same patterns. Furthermore, we show that the most divergent uploading behavior is observed when a high-popularity user initiates a tie with a user with lower popularity. We use social psychological motivations to explain these results. © 2013 INFORMS.","[{""_id"":""53f437dbdabfaeb2ac06083b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaohua Zeng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4d3dfdabfaeedd9781907"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Liyuan Wei"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1287/isre.1120.0464,"[""User-generated content"",""Social relation"",""Content generation"",""World Wide Web"",""Internet privacy"",""Social network"",""Upload"",""Content creation"",""Interpersonal ties"",""Optimal distinctiveness theory"",""Business""]",,15265536,1,"[""computer-mediated communication and collaboration"",""distinctiveness"",""flickr"",""photography"",""social networks"",""tags"",""user-generated content"",""within-subjects design"",""user generated content""]",en,35,87,71,null,"[""53e99bc6b7602d970246f468"",""55a4a9f665ceb7cb02d597d7"",""53e9b7c6b7602d970436f8fa"",""53e9b07db7602d9703ae7962"",""53e9a289b7602d9702b90443"",""53e9bb73b7602d97047b83ed"",""53e9ab5fb7602d97034f6480"",""53e99b43b7602d97023e557d"",""53e9a58cb7602d9702eb783a"",""53e9b2b8b7602d9703d5f387"",""53e9b1c3b7602d9703c55de8"",""53e99fbcb7602d9702897f91"",""53e9ac12b7602d97035d2b52"",""53e9a698b7602d9702fc9a0c"",""53e9bc10b7602d970487411c"",""53e9aae6b7602d9703465987"",""53e9a15bb7602d9702a4ff27"",""53e99dd4b7602d9702697900"",""53e9b828b7602d97043dfc91"",""53e9b6b4b7602d970423a7dd"",""53e9a86ab7602d97031b7b8a"",""53e9bb5ab7602d970479b4ad"",""53e9a5fdb7602d9702f282cc"",""53e9bbf0b7602d970484852e"",""6037697cd3485cfff1deac5e"",""53e9b56cb7602d97040a8006"",""53e9b290b7602d9703d33e55"",""53e9ae5cb7602d9703877c92"",""53e9bccbb7602d970494e4ca"",""53e999adb7602d97021f02e7"",""53e9a18db7602d9702a83cdb""]",Social Ties and User Content Generation: Evidence from Flickr.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/isre.1120.0464""]","{""_id"":""555036e57cea80f9541656e9"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Information Systems Research"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Information Systems Research"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",24,2013

53e99945b7602d9702182421,"A direct inter-mode selection algorithm for P-frames in fast homogeneous H.264/AVC bit-rate reduction transcoding is proposed in this paper. To achieve the direct inter-mode selection, we firstly develop a low-complexity distortion estimation method for fast transcoding, in which the distortion is directly calculated from the decoded residual together with the reference frames. We also present a linear estimation method to approximate the coding rate. With the estimated distortion and rate, the rate-distortion cost can be easily computed in the transcoder. In our algorithm, a method based on the normalized rate difference of P-frames (RP is used to detect the high motion scene. To achieve fast transcoding, only for the P-frames with RP larger than a threshold, the rate-distortion optimized (RDO mode decision is performed; meanwhile, the average cost of each inter-mode (ACM is calculated. Then for the subsequent frames transcoding, the optimal coding mode can be directly selected using the estimated cost and the ACM threshold. Experiments show that the proposed method can significantly simplify the complex RDO mode decision, and achieve transcoding time reductions of up to 62% with small loss of rate-distortion performance.

53e99915b7602d97021517f8,"We study the natural problem of secure n-party computation (in the computationally unbounded attack model of circuits over an arbitrary finite non-Abelian group (G,¿, which we call G-circuits. Besides its intrinsic interest, this problem is also motivating by a completeness result of Barrington, stating that such protocols can be applied for general secure computation of arbitrary functions. For flexibility, we are interested in protocols which only require black-box access to the group G (i.e. the only computations performed by players in the protocol are a group operation, a group inverse, or sampling a uniformly random group element. Our investigations focus on the passive adversarial model, where up to t of the n participating parties are corrupted.Our results are as follows. We initiate a novel approach for the construction of black-box protocols for G-circuits based on k-of-k threshold secret-sharing schemes, which are efficiently implementable over any black-box (non-Abelian group G. We reduce the problem of constructing such protocols to a combinatorial coloring problem in planar graphs. We then give three constructions for such colorings. Our first approach leads to a protocol with optimal resilience t<n/2, but it requires exponential communication complexity $O({\\binom{2 t+1}{t}}^{2} \\cdot N_{g}$ group elements and round complexity $O(\\binom{2 t + 1}{t} \\cdot N_{g}$ , for a G-circuit of size N g . Nonetheless, using this coloring recursively, we obtain another protocol to t-privately compute G-circuits with communication complexity $\\mathcal{P}\\mathit{oly}(n\\cdot N_{g}$ for any t¿O(n 1¿∈  where ∈ is any positive constant. For our third protocol, there is a probability ¿ (which can be made arbitrarily small for the coloring to be flawed in term of security, in contrast to the first two techniques, where the colorings are always secure (we call this protocol probabilistic, and those earlier protocols deterministic. This third protocol achieves optimal resilience t<n/2. It has communication complexity O(n 5.056(n+log¿¿ ¿12¿N g  and the number of rounds is O(n 2.528¿(n+log¿¿ ¿1¿N g .","[{""_id"":""53f42c56dabfaedd74d26f0e"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ctartary@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Yvo Desmedt"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London W1N 8AA, England"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London W1N 8AA, England""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f59003dabfaedc61f8045b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Josef Pieprzyk"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0002-1917-6466"",""org"":""Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43adddabfaec09f1a8178"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ron Steinfeld"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45471dabfaeecd69e3edc"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaoming Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Tsinghua Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Informat Sci, Inst Theoret Comp Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Informat Sci, Inst Theoret Comp Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f44a93dabfaedf435dda72"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Christophe Tartary"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Tsinghua Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Informat Sci, Inst Theoret Comp Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Informat Sci, Inst Theoret Comp Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f434b8dabfaec09f16dc90"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Huaxiong Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Math Sci, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Singapore, Singapore"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Math Sci, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Singapore, Singapore""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""56308a1e45ceb49c5dbdd0ee"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Andrew Chi-Chih Yao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Tsinghua Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Informat Sci, Inst Theoret Comp Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Informat Sci, Inst Theoret Comp Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s00145-011-9104-3,"[""Discrete mathematics"",""Inverse"",""Secure multi-party computation"",""Combinatorics"",""Random group"",""Communication complexity"",""Non-abelian group"",""Completeness (statistics"",""Planar graph"",""Mathematics"",""Graph coloring""]",,14321378,4,"[""Multiparty computation"",""Graph coloring"",""Non-Abelian group"",""Black-box operations"",""Planar graph"",""Percolation theory"",""Word problem""]",en,10,600,557,null,"[""53e9a09fb7602d97029879ba"",""53e99dccb7602d970268cfc4"",""53e9abebb7602d97035a780b"",""53e9b246b7602d9703ce4e40"",""53e9a91ab7602d970326da29"",""53e99a74b7602d97022e646b"",""599c7e5e601a182cd28960d0"",""53e9bcadb7602d970492a987"",""53e9b0c2b7602d9703b33545"",""53e9a6a6b7602d9702fd8171"",""53e9a32eb7602d9702c38798"",""53e9aad9b7602d970345aed3"",""53e99e61b7602d9702727643"",""53e9baecb7602d970471e0d1"",""53e9ad6cb7602d9703756993"",""53e9a611b7602d9702f437a5"",""56d81487dabfae2eee6878bd"",""53e9a85cb7602d97031a849c"",""56d8135adabfae2eee610834""]",Graph Coloring Applied to Secure Computation in Non-Abelian Groups,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00145-011-9104-3"",""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2724973.2725117&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=686125055&CFTOKEN=78848833&preflayout=flat"",""http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s00145-011-9104-3"",""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00145-011-9104-3"",""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00145-011-9104-3"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""53a731d820f7420be8d65d92"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""J.

53e99905b7602d9702141934,"Face recognition using image-set or video sequence as input tends to be more robust since image-set or video sequence provides much more information than single snapshot about the variation in the appearance of the target subject. Usually the distribution of such image-set approximately resides in a low dimensional linear subspace and the distance between image-set pairs can be defined based on the concept of principal angles between the corresponding subspace bases. Inspired by the work of [4,14], this paper presents a robust framework for image-set based face recognition using boosted global and local principal angles. The original multi-class classification problem is firstly transformed into a binary classification task where the positive class is the principal angle based intra-class subspace “difference” and the negative one is the principal angle based inter-class subspace “difference”. The principal angles are computed not only globally for the whole pattern space but also locally for a set of partitioned sub-patterns. The discriminative power of each principal angle for the global and each local sub-pattern is explicitly exploited by learning a strong classifier in a boosting manner. Extensive experiments on real life data sets show that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of classification accuracy.","[{""_id"":""53f7fecedabfae92b40fd9d0"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869470e1cd8e14a365d7b9"",""name"":""Xi Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5489c298dabfae9b40134d52"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c1e1cd8e14a34ca229"",""name"":""Kazuhiro Fukui"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""University of Tsukuba, Japan"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3081c455f439fe3ffa0"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542dfe70dabfae4b91c3aac8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869470e1cd8e14a365d7b9"",""name"":""Nanning Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-12307-8_30,"[""Facial recognition system"",""Pattern recognition"",""Binary classification"",""Subspace topology"",""Linear subspace"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Boosting (machine learning"",""Independent component analysis"",""Classifier (linguistics"",""Discriminative model"",""Mathematics""]",3-642-12306-6,16113349,1,"[""image-set pair"",""principal angle"",""face recognition"",""binary classification task"",""local principal angle"",""inter-class subspace"",""corresponding subspace base"",""low dimensional linear subspace"",""intra-class subspace"",""video sequence"",""multi class classification"",""binary classification""]",en,22,332,323,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e99905b7602d9702141934_0.pdf,"[""558abd1de4b0b32fcb389265"",""53e9b500b7602d97040319f9"",""53e997e8b7602d9701fe07cf"",""53e9a63db7602d9702f6af01"",""53e9b316b7602d9703dde7f3"",""53e9bc7fb7602d97048fca63"",""5582f73f0cf2320d1b996a2d"",""599c7dbb601a182cd284b42c"",""53e9a6d0b7602d970300769e"",""558a709ce4b0b32fcb36d275"",""53e9ba8ab7602d97046ac6cb"",""53e99f34b7602d97028008d9"",""53e99d36b7602d97025ebc14"",""53e9a7b3b7602d97030ed727""]",Image-Set based face recognition using boosted global and local principal angles,"[""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78650478670""]","{""_id"":""54824c66582fc50b5e008eb0"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Asian Conference on Computer Vision"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",5994,2010

53e9991cb7602d9702154ca1,"Combining multiple methodologies works in practice, but not yet in theory. One of the reasons is that current theorising is dominated by a paradigm mentality, preoccupied with wholesale philosophical legitimation. 'Paradigm' and the associated 'incommensurability' were once revolutionary heuristic tools; now they are mistaken for the basis of an essentialist foundation. The result is a stifling of intellectual innovation and a diminishing of practical relevance. For OR research to make a positive difference again, it is time to move beyond paradigm-based theorising. After paradigm, there are many opportunities. This paper explores a pragmatist alternative that is action-oriented, multiplicity-embracing, ethically concerned and politically sensitive. Incorporating ontological flexibility, it allows OR workers to enact multiple realities, craft ontology-in-use, weave available methods with situated particulars, justify methodologies based on practical consequences, so as to get jobs done and enhance competences. Promoting ontological flexibility and methodology-in-use is a useful starting point for after-paradigm theorising that supports innovative mixing-methodology practice.

53e9990db7602d970214d41c,"The fractional Fourier transform is a generalization of the classical Fourier transform, which is introduced from the mathematic
 aspect by Namias at first and has many applications in optics quickly. Whereas its potential appears to have remained largely
 unknown to the signal processing community until 1990s. The fractional Fourier transform can be viewed as the chirp-basis
 expansion directly from its definition, but essentially it can be interpreted as a rotation in the time-frequency plane, i.e.
 the unified time-frequency transform. With the order from 0 increasing to 1, the fractional Fourier transform can show the
 characteristics of the signal changing from the time domain to the frequency domain. In this research paper, the fractional
 Fourier transform has been comprehensively and systematically treated from the signal processing point of view. Our aim is
 to provide a course from the definition to the applications of the fractional Fourier transform, especially as a reference
 and an introduction for researchers and interested readers.","[{""_id"":""561b140045cedb3397eee7c4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c1e1cd8e14a34ca551"",""name"":""tao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""beijing institute of technology"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0fc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""561b140045cedb3397eee7c4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c1e1cd8e14a34ca551"",""name"":""ran"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""beijing institute of technology"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0fc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""540ff5f2dabfae450f4bbb3b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c1e1cd8e14a34ca551"",""name"":""deng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""beijing institute of technology"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0fc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""540ff5f2dabfae450f4bbb3b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c1e1cd8e14a34ca551"",""name"":""bing"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""beijing institute of technology"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0fc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c1e1cd8e14a34ca551"",""name"":""wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""beijing institute of technology"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0fc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c1e1cd8e14a34ca551"",""name"":""yue"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""beijing institute of technology"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0fc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-005-0240-y,"[""Non-uniform discrete Fourier transform"",""Constant Q transform"",""Harmonic wavelet transform"",""Mathematical analysis"",""Short-time Fourier transform"",""Fourier transform"",""Discrete Fourier transform (general"",""Discrete Fourier transform"",""Fractional Fourier transform"",""Mathematics""]",,18622836,1,"[""time domain"",""frequency domain"",""fourier transform"",""fractional fourier transform"",""time frequency"",""time frequency analysis"",""signal processing""]",en,124,25,1,null,"[""53e9b18fb7602d9703c16215"",""53e99b5db7602d9702403197"",""53e9bb29b7602d9704764f23"",""53e9b166b7602d9703beb2fe"",""53e9bb22b7602d970475b7ce"",""53e9be09b7602d9704abd86e"",""53e9ab78b7602d9703520b17"",""53e99c29b7602d97024d5d53"",""53e9b7cdb7602d9704378c8b"",""53e9b7eeb7602d970439f7b8"",""53e9b5a9b7602d97040f21e2"",""53e99aecb7602d9702377540"",""53e9a570b7602d9702e97aa7"",""53e9b19cb7602d9703c278a4"",""558aa989e4b0b32fcb381f70"",""55831e1e0cf2485614700735"",""53e9991cb7602d970215ae5d"",""53e9b0deb7602d9703b57c98"",""53e9b5afb7602d97040f84d0"",""53e9a091b7602d970297999f"",""53e9b8c0b7602d970449ec43"",""573695a76e3b12023e4c5c0f"",""53e9a308b7602d9702c111f3"",""573696466e3b12023e552dc8"",""53e9be14b7602d9704acb638"",""558a8adee4b037c08757c0af"",""558a3c6e84ae84d265bc678f"",""53e9b45eb7602d9703f58f59"",""573696466e3b12023e5529b0"",""53e9b0dfb7602d9703b5bca2""]",Research progress of the fractional Fourier transform in signal processing,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-005-0240-y"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-005-0240-y"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b77cea80f95414b7df"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Science in China Series F: Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",49,2006

Our method allows the user to adjust the analytic parameters of BSSRDF and provides high-quality, real-time rendering feedback. Inspired by recently developed Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT techniques, we approximate both the multiple scattering diffuse reflectance function and the sin- gle scattering exponential attenuation function in the analytic model using basis functions, so that re-computing the outgoing radiance at each vertex as parameters change reduces to simple dot products. In addition, using a non-uniform piecewise polynomial basis, we are able to achieve smaller approximation error than using bases adopted in previous PRT-based works, such as spherical harmonics and wavelets. Using hardware acceleration, we demonstrate that our system generates images comparable to (JMLH01 at real-time frame-rates.","[{""_id"":""53f432fadabfaee2a1cc3329"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Kun Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yue Gao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""56cb189cc35f4f3c6565553a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yong Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42ba6dabfaedd74d1c417"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Tao Ju"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542e017ddabfae4b91c3b7e4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Shi-min Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01077.x,"[""Polynomial basis"",""Computer vision"",""Computer science"",""Spherical harmonics"",""Algorithm"",""Scattering"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Basis function"",""Precomputed Radiance Transfer"",""Rendering (computer graphics"",""Approximation error"",""Piecewise""]",,14678659,3,"[""real time"",""approximation error"",""real time rendering"",""spherical harmonic"",""diffuse reflectance"",""hardware accelerator""]",en,38,552,545,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e99905b7602d9702143d4b_0.pdf,"[""53e9afbab7602d9703a09cc7"",""53e9b6eeb7602d970427e01e"",""53e9a981b7602d97032dcb44"",""53e99a0ab7602d970225b4f0"",""53e9a30fb7602d9702c179b3"",""53e9a2c0b7602d9702bc8132"",""53e9ab82b7602d97035298c8"",""53e99d74b7602d970262f488"",""53e9a94bb7602d970329e519"",""53e99f86b7602d970285d6be"",""53e9b5e0b7602d97041300c9"",""53e99a4eb7602d97022ae935"",""53e99ea0b7602d9702765993"",""53e9a9beb7602d970331f0ab"",""53e9abc4b7602d9703576dcf"",""53e9b174b7602d9703bfc1be"",""53e9b84ab7602d97044100dc"",""53e9b196b7602d9703c21f0b"",""53e9ae22b7602d9703831bc8""]",Real-time homogenous translucent material editing,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01077.x""]","{""_id"":""555036f07cea80f954166eba"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Computer Graphics Forum"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Comput.

53e99931b7602d970217204d,"Indoor target localization is an essential and fundamental issue for wireless sensor networks (WSN. However, it is rather difficult for WSN to maintain the localization accuracy in line-of-sight (LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS mixed environment. NLOS propagation always leads to larger ranging error than LOS does. When the target moves in the rooms and corridors, the signal transmission state will switch frequently between LOS and NLOS. It is a challenging task to deal with this situation because the ranging error characteristics under LOS and NLOS conditions are quite different. In this paper, we propose an interacting multiple model-extended Kalman filter (IMM-EKF algorithm to improve the localization accuracy for moving target in indoor environment. In the IMM structure, two Kalman filters (KF are adopted in parallel to accurately smoothen the distance measurement. The proposed algorithm can adapt to the dynamically changing condition between LOS and NLOS due to the two KFs' interaction so that large NLOS ranging errors are further reduced. Once the estimated ranges are obtained, the EKF is employed to estimate the target's location. Empirical measurement results are obtained from typical office environment to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results illustrate that the IMM smoother can efficiently mitigate the NLOS effects on ranging errors and achieve high localization accuracy. © 2013 Stolojescu-Crisan and Isar; licensee Springer.","[{""_id"":""53f46724dabfaeecd6a0ff4c"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zhangyunzhou@ise.neu.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Yunzhou Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45430dabfaee02ad507aa"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wenyan Fu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f430a6dabfaeb1a7bb4adf"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Dongfei Wei"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a69b2dabfae61d497945a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jianjun Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a5c88dabfae646d555f4c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Bing Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1186/1687-1499-2013-291,"[""Non-line-of-sight propagation"",""Distance measurement"",""Transmission (telecommunications"",""Extended Kalman filter"",""Computer science"",""Kalman filter"",""Real-time computing"",""Ranging"",""Empirical measure"",""Wireless sensor network"",""Embedded system""]",,16871499,1,"[""Moving target localization"",""Wireless sensor networks"",""Indoor environment"",""LOS/NLOS"",""Interacting multiple model""]",en,15,null,null,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e99931b7602d970217204d_0.pdf,"[""53e9a6fdb7602d97030343a9"",""53e9b968b7602d97045580c5"",""53e99d1ab7602d97025cc995"",""53e9b3e9b7602d9703ed8e85"",""53e9b1ffb7602d9703c9282d"",""53e9b3dab7602d9703ec7a06"",""53e9aa09b7602d97033771e8"",""558c56abe4b00c3c48e1b83b"",""53e99d7ab7602d9702638ebe"",""53e9a749b7602d9703080e68"",""53e9a751b7602d970308bb65"",""53e9b61bb7602d970417210b"",""558ae87ee4b037c08759e29d"",""53e9a472b7602d9702d8d4d0"",""53e9a20fb7602d9702b12d4c"",""53e9a7f1b7602d9703135c87"",""53e99c74b7602d9702523bd1"",""53e9b54fb7602d970408525c"",""53e9986eb7602d97020a7564"",""53e9b409b7602d9703eff498"",""53e9b910b7602d97044f3f2e"",""53e9aa6db7602d97033e128b"",""53e9bb66b7602d97047a4886"",""53e9bc15b7602d970487b6d4"",""53e9ad64b7602d970374c9d0"",""558bc34be4b00c3c48de537b"",""53e9a1d5b7602d9702ad3452"",""53e9abc9b7602d970357b69d""]",Moving target localization in indoor wireless sensor networks mixed with LOS/NLOS situations.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1687-1499-2013-291"",""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1687-1499-2013-291"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036f27cea80f954168665"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""EURASIP J.

53e99915b7602d9702152d65,"When reengineering a monolithic application to be a distributed one, programmers always have to decide how many distributed parts the application should be partitioned, and write many codes related to where a partwill be placed on network nodes and how these parts communicate with each other through the network. These codes usually have nothing to do with the business functions of the application, and they are laborious to write. In addition, as the distribution architecture of the application is finalized beforehand, it may not adapt well to the ever-changing execution environment. In this paper, we propose DPartner, an automatic partitioning system, to help programmers create a distributed Java application without explicitly writing the distribution-related codes. Unlike the other partitioning systems, DPartner does not partition an application directly into the coarse-grained client and server. Instead, it first partitions the application into several modules where each module performs a relatively independent business function of the application. Then it makes these modules be distributable through automatic bytecode rewriting. These modules can distribute in different nodes and cooperate to work just as the original monolithic application. Such a module-based partitioning approach enables a relatively easy reshaping of the distribution architecture of an application, which facilitates the application adapt to the environmental changes without manual recoding or repartitioning with regard to distribution. This paper gives the detailed design of DPartner, and evaluates it using real-world applications. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DPartner. © 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[{""_id"":""53f5998adabfaeea20f80485"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ying Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China"",""Peking Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542d6e7ddabfae11fc46e6cb"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zhangying06@sei.pku.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Gang Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China"",""Peking Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4b8f6dabfaed83b77b429"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wei Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China"",""Peking Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""548c918ddabfaed7b5fa446a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xuanzhe Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China"",""Peking Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5444d8b0dabfae87074ea6fe"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hong Mei"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China"",""Peking Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11704-012-2220-x,"[""Architecture"",""Bytecode rewriting"",""Monolithic application"",""Computer science"",""Node (networking"",""Business process reengineering"",""Java"",""Distributed computing""]",,16737466,6,"[""application partitioning"",""distributed computing"",""DPartner""]",en,12,740,725,null,"[""53e9b083b7602d9703aef56b"",""53e9a9b0b7602d970330e2e3"",""53e9bd7bb7602d9704a1cb7d"",""53e9bd4bb7602d97049d97ce"",""53e9b228b7602d9703cc397e"",""53e9ac8fb7602d9703664cda"",""53e999e0b7602d9702224c4c"",""558291a20cf2b2c1f110e797"",""53e9b326b7602d9703df4b36"",""53e9ab32b7602d97034bd69b"",""53e9a5a8b7602d9702ed53dc"",""53e9998bb7602d97021cc05b"",""558aba8ce4b037c08758cdc2"",""53e9b4d9b7602d9703ffd1e0"",""53e9a8a9b7602d97031f5a9e"",""53e9bc97b7602d970491844b""]",Towards module-based automatic partitioning of Java applications.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-012-2220-x"",""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11704-012-2220-x"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036bc7cea80f95414e73d"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Frontiers of Computer Science"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",6,2012

Simulated driving experiments are conducted in a refitted passenger car, during which grip forces of both hands are collected. Wavelet transformation is introduced to extract fatigue-related features from wavelet coefficients. We compare the performance of k-nearest neighbours, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machine (SVM on the task of discriminating drowsy and awake states. SVM with radial basis function reaches the best accuracy, 75% on average. The results show that variation in grip forces on steering wheel can be used to effectively detect drivers' fatigue. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""5602233b45cedb3395f18197"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Fan Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Center for Brain-Like Computing and Machine Intelligence(Center for Brain-Like Computing and Machine Intelligence,Center for Brain-like Computing and Machine Intelligence,,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b6f21c455f439fe5b83a"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f556dfdabfae963d25f80a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiao-Wei Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Center for Brain-Like Computing and Machine Intelligence(Center for Brain-Like Computing and Machine Intelligence,Center for Brain-like Computing and Machine Intelligence,,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b6f21c455f439fe5b83a"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f7a056dabfae8faa4a0d16"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c98f8"",""name"":""Bao-Liang Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""shanghai jiao tong university"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-42051-1_19,"[""Computer vision"",""Radial basis function"",""Simulation"",""Computer science"",""Support vector machine"",""Steering wheel"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Linear discriminant analysis"",""Grip force"",""Wavelet""]",,16113349,3,"[""fatigue detection"",""grip force"",""wavelet transformation""]",en,3,148,141,null,"[""53e9b587b7602d97040c7931"",""53e9bc42b7602d97048b3c23"",""53e9b2c6b7602d9703d7379d""]",Detection of Driving Fatigue Based on Grip Force on Steering Wheel with Wavelet Transformation and Support Vector Machine.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-42051-1_19""]","{""_id"":""53a72d5220f7420be8c611c4"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Conference on Neural Information Processing"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ICONIP (3"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",8228,2013

53e9990db7602d9702147296,"It is well known that Boolean functions used in stream and block ciphers should have high algebraic immunity to resist algebraic attacks. Up to now, there have been many constructions of Boolean functions achieving the maximum algebraic immunity. In this paper, we present several constructions of rotation symmetric Boolean functions with maximum algebraic immunity on an odd number of variables which are not symmetric, via a study of invertible cyclic matrices over the binary field. In particular, we generalize the existing results and introduce a new method to construct all the rotation symmetric Boolean functions that differ from the majority function on two orbits. Moreover, we prove that their nonlinearities are upper bounded by (equation required.

53e99960b7602d97021a3131,"In the area of massive gene expression analysis, Order-Preserving Sub-Matrices have been employed to find biological associations between genes and experimental conditions from a large number of gene expression datasets. While many techniques have been developed, few of them are parallel, and they lack the capability to incorporate the large-scale datasets or are very time-consuming. To help fill this critical void, we propose a Butterfly Network based parallel partitioning and mining method (BNPP, which formalizes the communication and data transfer among nodes. In the paper, we firstly give the details of OPSM and the implementations of OPSM on MapReduce and Hama BSP and their shortcomings. Then, we extend the Hama BSP framework using Butterfly Network to reduce the communication time, workload of bandwidth and duplicate results percent, and call the new framework as BNHB. Finally, we implement a state-of-the-art OPSM mining method (OPSM and our BNPP method on top of the framework of naïve Hama BSP and our BNHB, and the experimental results show that the computational speed of our methods are nearly one order faster than that of the implementation on a single machine and the proposed framework has better effectiveness and scalability. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","[{""_id"":""5459399bdabfaeb0fe34e55c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Tao Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5486297adabfae8a11fb302c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhanhuai Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a4cc3dabfae646d54b128"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qun Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5406c52adabfae450f3e9471"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhong Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a3480dabfae646d53f46c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wei Pan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f3220ddabfae9a8445bc49"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhuo Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-40285-2_13,"[""Data mining"",""Data transmission"",""Computer science"",""Workload"",""Parallel computing"",""Parallel processing"",""Implementation"",""Bandwidth (signal processing"",""Butterfly network"",""Data partitioning"",""Scalability""]",,16113349,1,"[""bsp model"",""butterfly network"",""data partitioning"",""gene expression data"",""hadoop"",""hama"",""mapreduce"",""opsm"",""parallel processing""]",en,4,144,129,null,"[""558b675fe4b037c0875cb227"",""53e9acf7b7602d97036d7f70"",""53e9baf6b7602d9704728e9a"",""53e9b05cb7602d9703abfda7"",""53e9b061b7602d9703ac7e47"",""53e9b6b9b7602d9704240234"",""53e9a40eb7602d9702d29920"",""53e9acf7b7602d97036d7f70"",""53e9adb6b7602d97037b6e39"",""53e9b437b7602d9703f33399"",""53e9b7f5b7602d97043a7d34"",""53e9bb52b7602d9704790954""]",Parallel Partitioning and Mining Gene Expression Data with Butterfly Network.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40285-2_13""]","{""_id"":""555037387cea80f95417ad1b"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Database and Expert Systems Applications"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""DEXA"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",8055,2013

53e99905b7602d97021419d4,"Recently, there has been significant theoretical progress towards fixed-parameter algorithms for the DOMINATING SET problem of planar graphs. It is known that the problem on a planar graph with n vertices and dominating number k can be solved in O (2O (sqrt(k n time using tree/branch-decomposition based algorithms. In this paper, we report computational results of Fomin and Thilikos algorithm which uses the branch-decomposition based approach. The computational results show that the algorithm can solve the DOMINATING SET problem of large planar graphs in a practical time and memory space for the class of graphs with small branchwidth. For the class of graphs with large branchwidth, the size of instances that can be solved by the algorithm in practice is limited to about one thousand edges due to a memory space bottleneck. The practical performances of the algorithm coincide with the theoretical analysis of the algorithm. The results of this paper suggest that the branch-decomposition based algorithms can be practical for some applications on planar graphs. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

53e9994cb7602d9702189a8d,"In this article, we consider distribution channel strategies for an incumbent manufacturer who produces two complementary products and must determine whether or not to have another company to sell its products. We identify factors that affect the manufacturer's motivation to use dual-channel distribution. Our results show that both complementarity between complements and product substitutability between firms influence the manufacturer's channel strategy. We find that if the potential entrant does not produce the complement of the primary product, a higher complementary effect for the complement will weaken the motivation of the incumbent to add an indirect channel. We also find that the incumbent has a stronger incentive to add the indirect channel when a product's substitutability is high. Furthermore, we show that when the two channels have the same pricing power, the incumbent has a stronger incentive to sell through the indirect channel in a higher pricing power environment. © 2012 Decision Sciences Institute.","[{""_id"":""53f42c7ddabfaee0d9aef95d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yusen Xia"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542e0c15dabfae11fc4bf356"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Tiaojun Xiao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42ea4dabfaee0d9b0d3f2"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""G.

To address this problem, this paper proposes an effective and scalable approach for video segmentation, aiming to cluster video pixels that are coherent in both appearance and motion. We build up a multi-layer graph based on multiple segmentations of the video frames, where each presegment corresponds to a vertex in the graph and each layer corresponds to the segmentation result using mean shift algorithm under specific granularity. Three types of edges are connected in the graph and the corresponding affinities are defined which convey local grouping cues of intra-frame, inter-frame and inter-layer neighborhoods. Then the task of video segmentation is formulated into graph partition, which can be solved efficiently by power iteration clustering algorithm. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.","[{""_id"":""53f435c8dabfaee0d9b606a8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86cb51e1cd8e14a3e0e16a"",""name"":""Xiaofei Di"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS, Beijing, China,Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing, China,Graduate School, Chinese Academy of Sciences ..."",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29f1c455f439fe3d25c"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f56ccfdabfae7138f804a6"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86cb1be1cd8e14a3df4f40"",""name"":""Hong Chang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS, Beijing, China,Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29f1c455f439fe3d25c"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54592d5ddabfaeb0fe339cfb"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86cb1be1cd8e14a3df4f40"",""name"":""Xilin Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS, Beijing, China,Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29f1c455f439fe3d25c"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-37444-9_1,"[""Spectral clustering"",""Computer vision"",""Scale-space segmentation"",""Segmentation"",""Segmentation-based object categorization"",""Image segmentation"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Mean-shift"",""Graph partition"",""Cluster analysis"",""Mathematics""]",,16113349,2,"[""layer corresponds"",""multi-layer graph"",""video segmentation"",""multiple segmentation"",""graph partition"",""mean shift algorithm"",""segmentation result"",""cluster video pixel"",""multi-layer spectral"",""incoherence problem"",""video frame""]",en,5,12,1,null,"[""557de0db6fee0fe990ca52ea"",""558baff384ae6766fdeea7bf"",""53e9aaf3b7602d9703475ad1"",""53e9a22bb7602d9702b31911"",""53e9ab20b7602d97034a7315"",""53e9b5fab7602d970414cac3"",""53e9b885b7602d9704459b64"",""53e9b05cb7602d9703abfcb0"",""53e9aaf3b7602d9703475ad1"",""53e9ad87b7602d970377cdfc"",""53e9a825b7602d9703170665"",""53e9982cb7602d970205033f"",""53e9bb29b7602d9704765e95"",""53e9b2d1b7602d9703d7d132"",""53e9a987b7602d97032e100e"",""558a94fae4b0b32fcb37a92f"",""53e9ac28b7602d97035edb29"",""53e9afe8b7602d9703a3af5a"",""53e9989bb7602d97020d35a8"",""558b6276e4b037c0875c94ff"",""53e9ab25b7602d97034ac260""]",Multi-layer spectral clustering for video segmentation,"[""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875899512""]","{""_id"":""54824c66582fc50b5e008eb0"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Asian Conference on Computer Vision"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7725,2013
53e99940b7602d970217c916,"This paper proposes an adaptive chaos quantum honey bee algorithm (CQHBA for solving chance-constrained programming in random
 fuzzy environment based on random fuzzy simulations. Random fuzzy simulation is designed to estimate the chance of a random
 fuzzy event and the optimistic value to a random fuzzy variable. In CQHBA, each bee carries a group of quantum bits representing
 a solution. Chaos optimization searches space around the selected best-so-far food source. In the marriage process, random
 interferential discrete quantum crossover is done between selected drones and the queen. Gaussian quantum mutation is used
 to keep the diversity of whole population. New methods of computing quantum rotation angles are designed based on grads. A
 proof of convergence for CQHBA is developed and a theoretical analysis of the computational overhead for the algorithm is
 presented. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate its superiority in robustness and stability, efficiency of computational

We investigate the controllability for the pest by acting on eggs in a small age interval. The main method is based on the derivation of estimations for the adjoint variables related to an optimal control problem. A fixed point theorem is then used to draw conclusions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.,"[{""_id"":""53f43b3edabfaee0d9b93c2d"",""bio"":null,""email"":""heyuan403@gmail.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Yuan He"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux,UMR CNRS 5251, Université de Bordeaux,Bordeaux Cedex,France"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b34a1c455f439fe41d64"",""orgs"":[""Univ Bordeaux, UMR CNRS 5251, Inst Math Bordeaux, F-33076 Bordeaux, France"",""Lanzhou Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46744dabfaee43ecf9fc8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Bedr'Eddine Ainseba"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux,UMR CNRS 5251, Université de Bordeaux,Bordeaux Cedex,France"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b34a1c455f439fe41d64"",""orgs"":[""Univ Bordeaux, UMR CNRS 5251, Inst Math Bordeaux, F-33076 Bordeaux, France""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s10957-012-0194-3,"[""Boundary value problem"",""Applied mathematics"",""Optimal control"",""Controllability"",""Mathematical analysis"",""Mathematics"",""Fixed-point theorem"",""Age structure"",""Theory of computation""]",,15732878,3,"[""characteristics method"",""exact null controllability"",""fixed point theorem"",""integral partial differential equation"",""population dynamics""]",en,0,933,918,null,"[""53e9bc00b7602d970485d0ba"",""53e9bd98b7602d9704a40b7f""]",Exact Null Controllability of a Stage and Age-Structured Population Dynamics System.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10957-012-0194-3"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10957-012-0194-3"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036d27cea80f95415a4e1"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""J.

53e99940b7602d970217e5e2,"In this paper we consider the single machine scheduling problem with truncated exponential learning functions. By the truncated exponential learning functions, we mean that the actual job processing time is a function which depends not only on the total normal processing times of the jobs already processed but also on a control parameter. The use of the truncated function is to model the phenomenon that the learning of a human activity is limited. We show that even with the introduction of the proposed model to job processing times, several single machine problems remain polynomially solvable. For the following three objective functions, the total weighted completion time, the discounted total weighted completion time, the maximum lateness, we present heuristic algorithms according to the corresponding problems without truncated exponential learning functions. We also analyse the worst-case bound of our heuristic algorithms. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","[{""_id"":""53f642c5dabfaecc6cc71628"",""bio"":null,""email"":""wangjibo75@yahoo.com.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Ji-Bo Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shenyang Aerosp Univ, Sch Sci, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Shenyang Aerosp Univ, Sch Sci, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China"",""State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710053, Peoples R China"",""Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Knowledge Management & Innovat Res Ctr, Xian 710049, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fd9705dabfae8faa5adae6"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiao-Yuan Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shenyang Aerosp Univ, Sch Sci, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Shenyang Aerosp Univ, Sch Sci, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China"",""Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4473fdabfaee2a1d3793c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Linhui Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710054, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Xian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710054, Peoples R China"",""State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710053, Peoples R China"",""Minist Educ Proc Control & Efficiency Engn, Key Lab, Xian 710049, Peoples R China"",""Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Knowledge Management & Innovat Res Ctr, Xian 710049, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45069dabfaee4dc7f9c91"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Linyan Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China"",""State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn, Xian 710053, Peoples R China"",""Minist Educ Proc Control & Efficiency Engn, Key Lab, Xian 710049, Peoples R China"",""Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Knowledge Management & Innovat Res Ctr, Xian 710049, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11590-011-0433-9,"[""Learning effect"",""Heuristic"",""Single-machine scheduling"",""Mathematical optimization"",""Exponential function"",""Computational intelligence"",""Scheduling (computing"",""Heuristic (computer science"",""Completion time"",""Mathematics""]",,18624480,8,"[""Scheduling"",""Single machine"",""Learning effect"",""Heuristic algorithm""]",en,14,1873,1857,null,"[""53e99b4ab7602d97023ed4e3"",""53e9a9a9b7602d9703308052"",""53e9a0fcb7602d97029e93f2"",""53e9b0bcb7602d9703b2af46"",""53e9a9a9b7602d9703308052"",""53e9a9f0b7602d9703359e9e"",""53e9b682b7602d97041ee2b5"",""56d8ecfbdabfae2eee5c8787"",""53e9b9bab7602d97045b1a7d"",""53e9b621b7602d970417a870"",""5cc9a3366558b90bfa1d18e4"",""53e9b885b7602d970445823e"",""53e9b310b7602d9703dd9c69"",""53e9ac96b7602d970367228f"",""53e9af99b7602d97039e1d93"",""5b6739a4ab2dfb7a2025a277"",""53e9b8c0b7602d970449d494"",""53e9b885b7602d970445820f"",""53e999eeb7602d9702235589"",""53e9a51db7602d9702e4168e"",""5cc9a3366558b90bfa1d18de"",""53e9ba38b7602d9704645d2d"",""53e9bb6cb7602d97047acfbb"",""53e9a775b7602d97030b170b"",""53e9b403b7602d9703ef565b"",""53e9a974b7602d97032cfecf""]",Scheduling jobs with truncated exponential learning functions.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11590-011-0433-9"",""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11590-011-0433-9"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036d27cea80f95415a4dc"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Optimization Letters"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7,2013
53e99940b7602d970217f452,"Abstract This paper presents a rate control scheme,for H.264 by introducing,the concept,of basic unit and a linear prediction model. The basic unit can be a macroblock (MB, a slice, or a frame. The linear model,is used,to predict the mean,absolute,differences (MADs of the remaining,basic units in the current stored picture by those of the co-located basic units in the previous,stored picture. The target bits for the current stored picture are computed,by adopting a fluid flow traffic model and linear tracking theory, and are further bounded by two values that are derived by taking the hypothetical,reference decoder,(HRD into consid- eration. The remaining,bits are allocated to the remaining,basic units in the current stored pic- ture according,to their predicted,MADs. The corresponding,quantization,parameter,is computed,by using,a quadratic,rate-distortion model. The rate distortion optimization (RDO is then performed,for all MBs in the current basic unit by the quantization,parameter. Both constant bit rate and variable bit rate cases are studied. The average PSNR is improved by up to 0.8 dB for an encoder,using our scheme,compared,to an encoder,using a fixed quantization parameter. With our scheme, an H.264 encoder can be adaptive to time varying channel bandwidth,that is available for the coding process. � 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

53e9995ab7602d970219cbd6,"The water and energy transfer of land surface is complex due to its large spatial and temporal variability. The modeling and simulation is an important means to study land water and energy transfer, but most selection and analysis of model parameters are empirical and qualitative. This paper has proposed a method of quantitatively identifying the most influential parameters of Common Land Model through Sobol' sensitivity analysis. Considering sensible heat flux as the model output, the first order and total sensitivity indices of 25 model input parameters are estimated using an improved Sobol' method. The simulated results are resampled using a bootstrapping method and the corresponding sensitivity indices are calculated. Confidence intervals for the bootstrapping sensitivity indices are estimated by using a percentile method. The results show that the parameters phi0 and porsl are the most important parameters, followed by ref(2,1, tran(2,1 and bsw. Five out of 25 parameters need to have an accurate evaluation, while the other parameters are fixed to a certain value. The sensitivity indices of parameters phi0 and porsl are decreasing after precipitation, while the sensitivity indices of parameters tran(2, 1 and ref(2, 1 are increasing after precipitation. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[{""_id"":""53f42674dabfaeb2acfa850b"",""bio"":null,""email"":""xujianhui306@163.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Jianhui Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0001-6330-7948"",""org"":""Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a43ccdabfae646d546562"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hong Shu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f432f5dabfaedd74d7cf32"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hongnan Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xinjiang Univ, Resource & Environm Sci Coll, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Xinjiang Univ, Resource & Environm Sci Coll, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5405b07ddabfae92b41f43b4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lin Dong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s12145-012-0105-z,"[""Monte Carlo method"",""Bootstrapping"",""Modeling and simulation"",""Sensible heat"",""Statistics"",""Confidence interval"",""Sobol sequence"",""Percentile"",""Mathematics"",""Precipitation""]",,18650481,34,"[""Common land model"",""Sensible heat flux"",""Sobol' sensitivity analysis"",""Monte Carlo"",""Bootstrapping""]",en,5,179,167,null,"[""53e9a091b7602d9702978594"",""53e9ba11b7602d970461627d"",""53e9aeebb7602d9703918835"",""53e99fc2b7602d970289c125"",""53e99e04b7602d97026c5c7a"",""53e9b911b7602d97044f9a0c"",""53e9986eb7602d97020a7c42""]",Sobol' sensitivity analysis of parameters in the common land model for simulation of water and energy fluxes.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12145-012-0105-z"",""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12145-012-0105-z"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036ef7cea80f954166e9d"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Earth Science Informatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",5,2012

This paper investigates the sampling of bandlimited signals in LCT domain. First, we propose the linear canonical series (LCS based on the LCT, which is a generalized pattern of Fourier series. Moreover, the LCS inherits all the nice properties from the LCT. Especially, the Parseval's relation is presented for the LCS, which is used to derive the sampling theorem of LCT. Then, utilizing the generalized form of Parseval's relation for the complex LCS, we obtain the sampling expansion for bandlimited signals in LCT domain. The advantage of this reconstruction method is that the sampling expansion can be deduced directly not based on the Shannon theorem. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","[{""_id"":""53f43580dabfaec22ba799f9"",""bio"":null,""email"":""deyunwei@yahoo.com.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Deyun Wei"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Natl Key Lab Tunable Laser Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f3ac52dabfae4b34aff4a4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiwen Ran"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Natl Key Lab Tunable Laser Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China"",""Harbin Inst Technol, Nat Sci Res Ctr, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f451a8dabfaeee22a22882"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yuanmin Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Mathematics,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Dept Math, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11760-011-0258-0,"[""Applied mathematics"",""Signal processing"",""Discrete mathematics"",""Bandlimiting"",""Reconstruction method"",""Shannon–Hartley theorem"",""Parseval's theorem"",""Fourier series"",""Sampling (statistics"",""Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem"",""Mathematics""]",,18631711,3,"[""bandlimited signal"",""linear canonical series"",""linear canonical transform"",""sampling""]",en,12,558,553,null,"[""53e998a9b7602d97020e1e0c"",""53e9bbeab7602d9704844633"",""53e9b166b7602d9703beb2fe"",""558a949c84ae84d265be6ee4"",""53e9bc4eb7602d97048c596f"",""53e9ab97b7602d9703541356"",""53e99804b7602d9702015f71"",""53e9a870b7602d97031bfcfd"",""53e99bdcb7602d970248721e"",""573696466e3b12023e552dc8"",""53e9a255b7602d9702b5f6c5"",""53e999b4b7602d97021f69f1"",""53e9b746b7602d97042e00ab"",""53e9b7eeb7602d970439f7b8"",""53e99945b7602d97021816c8"",""53e9ac12b7602d97035d5cdd""]",Sampling of bandlimited signals in the linear canonical transform domain.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11760-011-0258-0"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11760-011-0258-0"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036f27cea80f954168662"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Signal, Image and Video Processing"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7,2013
53e99991b7602d97021d2494,"In this paper, we investigate how to achieve call admission control (CAC for guaranteeing call dropping probability QoS which is caused by handoff timeout in cognitive radio (CR networks. When primary user (PU appears, spectrum handoff should be initiated to maintain secondary user (SU's link. We propose a novel virtual queuing (VQ scheme to schedule spectrum handoff requests sent by multiple SUs. Unlike the conventional first-come-first-served (FCFS scheduling, resuming transmission in the original channel has higher priority than switching to another channel. It costs less because it avoids the cost of signaling frequent spectrum switches. We characterize the handoff delay on the effectof PU's behavior and the number of SUs in CR networks. And user capacity under certain QoS requirement is derived as a guideline for CAC. The analytical results show that call dropping performance can be greatly improved by CAC when a large amount of SUs arrives fast as well as the VQ scheme is verified to reduce handoff cost compared to existing methods. ? 2014 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","[{""_id"":""542a0b0adabfae5848a8fa21"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ling Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43090dabfaee2a1ca504f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qicong Peng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f437ffdabfaeecd696d97e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qihang Peng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1587/transcom.E97.B.49,"[""Computer science"",""Call Admission Control"",""Computer network"",""Queueing theory"",""Handover"",""Cognitive radio""]",,17451345,1,"[""call admission control"",""cognitive radio"",""preemptive"",""queuing theory"",""spectrum handoff""]",en,0,55,49,null,"[""53e9a091b7602d97029760ab"",""53e99e28b7602d97026eede1"",""53e99af2b7602d970237d121"",""53e9b083b7602d9703af0162"",""53e9a1c3b7602d9702abcff8"",""53e9b145b7602d9703bc4e4e"",""53e9b0b7b7602d9703b2a0f0"",""53e9af06b7602d970393b95e"",""558bea29e4b00c3c48df363a"",""53e9bb5ab7602d970479cb9b"",""53e99e99b7602d970275f6e5""]",Handoff Delay-Based Call Admission Control in Cognitive Radio Networks.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1587/transcom.E97.B.49"",""http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e97-b_1_49""]","{""_id"":""555036cc7cea80f95415814b"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""IEICE Transactions on Communications"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IEICE Transactions"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",97,2014

This paper extends a component calculus to deal, in an effective way, with them. The calculus models components as generalised Mealy machines, i. e., state-based entities interacting along their life time through well defined interfaces of observers and actions. QoS is introduced through an algebraic structure specifying the relevant QoS domain and how its values are composed under different disciplines.

The algorithm uses the method of Lengendre polynomials expansion to compute the two dimensional point target reference spectrum, and this spectrum is used to perform the range cell migration correction (RCMC, secondary range compression and azimuth compression. In particular, the Doppler-centroid and bistatic-range dependent interpolation for residual RCMC is presented in detail. In addition, a method that combines the ambiguity and resolution theories to determine the forward-looking imaging swath is also presented in this paper.

53e9996eb7602d97021b040d,"As most applications in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN are location sensitive, in this paper, we explore the problem of location-aided multicast for WSN. We present four strategies to construct the GeoMulticast routing tree, namely, SARF, SAM, CoFAM and MSAM. Especially, we discuss CoFAM in detail and give the algorithm for setting up a multicast tree in a cone-based forwarding area. This algorithm is distributed and energy-efficient. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed routing schemas. Simulation results have shown that when constructing a multicast tree, fewer messages must be transmitted in our schemas.

In this paper, the optimal stopping theory is applied to fast mode decision for multiview video coding in order to reduce the tremendous encoding computational complexity, with the benefit of theoretical decision-making expectation and predictable decision performance. The characteristics of encoding modes in multiview video coding are studied to derive an optimal stopping theory-based model to early terminate mode decision and thus a fast mode decision algorithm is designed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can save a great amount of encoding time for multiview video coding and meanwhile keep the compression performance more or less intact. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""53f5b39cdabfae3c06f8045b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hanli Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45bc8dabfaee4dc82645a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yue Heng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f460e6dabfaee02ad7e79c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Tiesong Zhao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f38cc7dabfae4b34a3b528"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Bo Xiao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_17,"[""Optimal stopping"",""Computer science"",""Algorithm"",""Multiview Video Coding"",""Real-time computing"",""Fast mode"",""Encoding (memory"",""Computational complexity theory""]",,16113349,2,[],en,3,186,176,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/884/48/1539/53e999cab7602d970220f2fd_0.pdf,"[""53e9ba11b7602d9704617a65"",""53e9b527b7602d970405b6c5"",""53e9b181b7602d9703c08f10"",""53e9a1d5b7602d9702acdae3"",""53e9b923b7602d970450b12b"",""53e9be3cb7602d9704afa717"",""53e99e9ab7602d970276506a"",""53e99f64b7602d9702834ca5"",""53e9ba2db7602d970463b339"",""53e9b26eb7602d9703d1029b""]",Fast Mode Decision Based on Optimal Stopping Theory for Multiview Video Coding.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_17""]","{""_id"":""53a72cac20f7420be8c4c673"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Conference on Multimedia Modeling"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7733,2013

However, for the small size of femtocell and potentially frequent power on/off, existing handover schemes may not be reliable enough for femtocell networks. Moreover, improper handover parameters settings may lead to handover failures and unnecessary handovers, which make it necessary to enhance the mobility robustness for femtocells. In this article, we propose a gradient method and cost function-based mobility robustness optimization scheme for long term evolution (LTE femtocell self-organizing networks. Moreover, signalling overhead of the scheme is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a better performance than the fixed parameters method in terms of reduced the number of handover failures and unnecessary handovers with limited signalling modifications. © 2013 Zheng et al.","[{""_id"":""54069589dabfae44f0843ad3"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zhengweius@gmail.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Wei Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b21c455f439fe3d96f"",""orgs"":[""Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing Key Lab Network Syst Architecture & Conve, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54057d87dabfae8faa5d8133"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zhj@bupt.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Haijun Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b21c455f439fe3d96f"",""orgs"":[""Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing Key Lab Network Syst Architecture & Conve, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5406dc5fdabfae44f0864255"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaoli Chu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0003-1863-6149"",""org"":""Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering,University of Sheffield,Sheffield,UK"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29a1c455f439fe3cfd7"",""orgs"":[""Univ Sheffield, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46b29dabfaee2a1dc1f37"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiangming Wen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence,Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b21c455f439fe3d96f"",""orgs"":[""Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing Key Lab Network Syst Architecture & Conve, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1186/1687-1499-2013-27,"[""Gradient method"",""Wireless network"",""Femtocell"",""Signalling"",""Computer science"",""Computer network"",""Robustness (computer science"",""Handover""]",,16871499,1,"[""User Equipment"","" Mobility Management"","" Late Handover"","" Handover Decision"","" Handover Procedure""]",en,33,null,null,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/915/1475/406/53e999adb7602d97021eed64_0.pdf,"[""54890c9f45ce471f90a807b5"",""53e9addbb7602d97037e4c16"",""53e9a003b7602d97028e8819"",""53e9ad92b7602d970378f14c"",""53e99f3bb7602d970280d418"",""53e9a49db7602d9702dbeafd"",""53e9ab55b7602d97034ea5a0"",""53e9a08ab7602d9702973a62"",""53e99915b7602d9702150c11"",""53e9babab7602d97046e7ff0"",""53e99e38b7602d97026f93cc"",""53e9a7bbb7602d97030faf3c"",""53e9b290b7602d9703d3368b"",""558c1bd0e4b00c3c48e048aa"",""53e9b077b7602d9703ade010"",""53e99f28b7602d97027f7715"",""53e9acd2b7602d97036ad09a"",""53e9b976b7602d97045637af"",""53e9b3fdb7602d9703eeee69"",""53e9b7f5b7602d97043a9fe5""]",Mobility robustness optimization in self-organizing LTE femtocell networks.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1687-1499-2013-27"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1186/1687-1499-2013-27"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036f27cea80f954168665"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""EURASIP J.

To optimize the expected performance of such system as a function of several input parameters, we propose a hybrid stochastic approximation algorithm for finding the root of the gradient of the response function. At each iteration of the hybrid algorithm, alternatively, either an average of two independent noisy negative gradient directions or a scaled noisy negative gradient direction is selected.

For handling a kind of workflow time exceptions in advance, which is caused by the violation of deadline constraints in a process instance, an algorithm based on history logs is presented in the paper. Firstly, a time probability model of a process based on its history logs is built to model the indeterminacy of the execution time of tasks. Secondly, an algorithm is presented to detect potential time exceptions by analyzing the time probability model and the workload of current resources. To handle potential time exceptions, the task scheduling strategy adjustment (TSA and the task execution time compression (TEC are invoked to recover time loss.

 their skills and local knowledge in a community. A task initiator, with a virtual sensor to perceive the advertised skills
 and with an adaptive belief model about the community, seeks for the best matched partners for cooperation. The belief model
 is a fuzzy neural network based on Adaptive Resonance Theory which takes the advertisements of actors as its initial belief
 and learns actors’ actual capabilities through interaction experience. Dynamic alliances can then take place in an automated/semi-automated
 way that exhibit adaptive ability, self-organisation, unsupervised learning and competition ability. The alliances thus exhibit
 the inherent characteristics of realistic enterprises or human societies.","[{""_id"":""542a38f2dabfae646d54182d"",""bio"":null,""email"":""P.Jiang@Bradford.ac.uk"",""gid"":""5b86b0ace1cd8e14a3209a27"",""name"":""Ping Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""University of Bradford Department of Computing Bradford BD7 1DP UK"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29e1c455f439fe3d1cd"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45984dabfaedd74e3a39b"",""bio"":null,""email"":""q.mair@gcal.ac.uk"",""gid"":""5b86c766e1cd8e14a3c45190"",""name"":""Quentin Mair"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Glasgow Caledonian University Department of Computing Glasgow G4 0BA UK"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2bb1c455f439fe3dd8d"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45663dabfaee1c0b2d751"",""bio"":null,""email"":""fzr9910@xjtu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86b105e1cd8e14a3232919"",""name"":""Zu-Ren Feng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University Systems Engineering Institute Xi’an 710049 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s10845-007-0032-x,"[""Adaptive resonance theory"",""Ontology"",""Virtual organisation"",""Alliance"",""Virtual state"",""Knowledge management"",""Semantic Web"",""Unsupervised learning"",""Engineering"",""Artificial neural network""]",,15728145,3,"[""Virtual organisation"",""Multi-agent"",""Belief model"",""ART network""]",en,6,448,433,null,"[""53e9adf6b7602d97038002c0"",""53e9ae05b7602d97038124e9"",""53e9bc5bb7602d97048d27ca"",""53e9afb3b7602d9703a00976"",""53e997f1b7602d9701ff1508"",""53e9a86ab7602d97031b8dd9"",""53e997fcb7602d9702009bc6"",""53e9ae96b7602d97038b780f"",""53e9b59bb7602d97040e2a29"",""53e9bc15b7602d970487cde9"",""53e9b8f5b7602d97044d83e8"",""53e99a97b7602d970230c519"",""53e9b9e7b7602d97045df143"",""53e9a6aeb7602d9702fe3971"",""53e99b7fb7602d9702428dbe"",""53e99d36b7602d97025ef178"",""53e9abf6b7602d97035b5812"",""53e9ad6cb7602d970375acc4"",""53e9b7c7b7602d9704376090"",""53e9998bb7602d97021cc2d7"",""53e99946b7602d9702184ca4"",""53e9a263b7602d9702b673c6"",""53e9b884b7602d970445453b"",""53e9a501b7602d9702e25998"",""53e9a85cb7602d97031a434c"",""53e9a8c5b7602d97032130b8"",""53e9bb23b7602d9704760d84"",""53e9a1d5b7602d9702ace9f1"",""53e9bc00b7602d970485d908"",""53e9b732b7602d97042c95c3"",""53e9b57cb7602d97040bcad4"",""53e9b90ab7602d97044ed3e0"",""53e9bdc6b7602d9704a72967"",""53e9a539b7602d9702e5cf8b""]",Agent alliance formation using ART-networks as agent belief models,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10845-007-0032-x"",""http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10845-007-0032-x"",""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10845-007-0032-x"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036cf7cea80f954158d38"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""J.

 means of statistics. The feature points are obtained using the cosine of the angle between the two vectors of the point and
 the consecutive two points. Different compression transformations with weighted coordinates are performed on different strokes

In every iteration, the evolving curve works as a spatial constraint on the fuzzy clustering, and the clustering result is utilized to construct the fuzzy region force. On one hand, the fuzzy region force provides a powerful capability to avoid the leakages at weak boundaries and enhances the robustness to various noises. On the other hand, the local information obtained from the gradient feature map contributes to locating the object boundaries accurately and improves the performance on the images with heterogeneous foreground or background. Experimental results on synthetic and real images have shown that our model can precisely extract object boundaries and perform better than the existing representative hybrid active contour approaches.

In particular, our model called NB-LDA assumes that each sentence instead of word has a latent sentiment label, and then the sentiment label generates a series of features for the sentence independently in the Naïve Bayes manner. The idea of NB assumption at sentence level makes it possible that we can use advanced NLP technologies such as dependency parsing to improve the performance for unsupervised sentiment analysis.

In this paper, two revised Worm-Anti-Worm (WAW models are proposed for cloud-based benign worm countermeasure. These Re-WAW models are based on the law of worm propagation and the two-factor model. One is the cloudbased benign Re-WAWmodel to achieve effective worm containment. Another is the two-stage Re-WAW propagation model, which uses proactive and passive switching defending strategy based on the ratio of benign worms to malicious worms. This model intends to avoid the network congestion and other potential risks caused by the proactive scan of benign worms. Simulation results show that the cloud-based Re-WAW model significantly improves the worm propagation containment effect. The cloud computing technology enables rapid delivery of massive initial benign worms, and the two stage Re-WAW model gradually clears off the benign worms with the containment of the malicious worms. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","[{""_id"":""53f43ce1dabfaee43ec65ced"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zxufei@swu.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Xufei Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Southwest Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f48c7ddabfaea7cd1ceffd"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Tao Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43221dabfaeb22f4446fa"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yonghui Fang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""State Key Lab Power Transmiss Equipment & Syst Se, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""State Key Lab Power Transmiss Equipment & Syst Se, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11227-012-0812-8,"[""Countermeasure"",""Light load"",""Computer security"",""Computer science"",""Network congestion"",""Cloud computing""]",,15730484,3,"[""Worm propagation"",""Benign worm"",""Re-WAW model"",""Cloud-based Re-WAW model"",""Two-stage Re-WAW model""]",en,4,1479,1451,null,"[""53e9b0b2b7602d9703b22d4f"",""53e9b206b7602d9703c9b8f4"",""53e9aa80b7602d97033f8f0b"",""53e9ab9eb7602d970354909f"",""53e99a91b7602d9702305723"",""53e9ad87b7602d9703780f78"",""53e99905b7602d9702143fa3"",""53e9ade9b7602d97037f5ebc"",""53e99d2fb7602d97025e56fe"",""53e9ad05b7602d97036e6c5c"",""53e9b29cb7602d9703d43503"",""53e9ac19b7602d97035dddc8"",""53e9a63db7602d9702f6b016"",""53e9a216b7602d9702b19a4a"",""53e9a5afb7602d9702ed68c4"",""53e99a52b7602d97022babec"",""53e99f64b7602d97028350fc"",""53e9a3e1b7602d9702cf5d53"",""53e9a77bb7602d97030b2481"",""53e9b5ceb7602d97041173f2"",""53e9a3edb7602d9702d08413"",""53e9b76eb7602d97043109f5"",""53e9b489b7602d9703f8ced2"",""557da242f6678c77ea21bf4e"",""53e9ad98b7602d97037940d5"",""53e9a1cfb7602d9702ac6130""]",Strategy of fast and light-load cloud-based proactive benign worm countermeasure technology to contain worm propagation.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-012-0812-8"",""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-012-0812-8"",""http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11227-012-0812-8"",""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-012-0812-8"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""5390797020f770854f5bb908"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""The Journal of Supercomputing"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",62,2012
53e99991b7602d97021d7769,"In wireless networks, how to provide reliable data transfer is an important and challenging issue due to channel fading and interference. Several approaches, e.g., Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ, Hybrid ARQ (HARQ and Network Coding (NC, are used to enhance reliability of transmission in wireless networks. However, we note that these schemes implement the data recovery process for mixed unicast and multicast (MUM communications by simply separating the process into two phases, unicast and multicast phase. This is inefficient and expensive. In this paper, we propose an efficient retransmission scheme with network coding for MUM transmission, aiming at improving bandwidth utilization. UMNC searches for coding opportunities from both unicast and multicast flows, which offer the potential benefit of improved recovery in the event of packet loss. We theoretically prove that UMNC can effectively reduce the total number of retransmissions and thus improve bandwidth efficiency, compared with existing schemes.

53e999b4b7602d97021fac36,"Secure multiparty computation has become a central research focus in the international cryptographic community. Secure comparing
 two sets is an important problem in secure multiparty computation. The research on privately determining whether two sets
 are equal has not been investigated. This study solves the problem by mapping these sets into natural numbers and then comparing

53e99984b7602d97021c400c,"Multicast is a communication abstract in which a process sends a message to a group of processes. Group multicast is a kind of multicast where only members of the group can multicast to the group and every member of the group is allowed to multicast to the group. The routing of group multicast is to find a set of routing trees, one for each group member, for multicasting messages to the group. The traditional method is to generate each of this set of trees independently from the others and each of the trees is made optimal in terms of network cost. However, the overall network cost of the set of optimal trees may not be optimal. This paper proposes an algorithm for generating a set of routing trees, which aims at optimizing the overall cost of the set of routing trees of the group. Simulations have been done to compare our algorithm with the traditional method in various network situations. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","[{""_id"":""548d7413dabfaed7b5fa486e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b71be1cd8e14a34f2679"",""name"":""Jia XH"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4c71c455f439fe4c748"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b71be1cd8e14a34f2679"",""name"":""Wang LS"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4c71c455f439fe4c748"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",,"[""Protocol Independent Multicast"",""Source-specific multicast"",""Multicast address"",""Steiner tree problem"",""Computer science"",""Xcast"",""Computer network"",""Pragmatic General Multicast"",""Multicast"",""Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol"",""Distributed computing""]",,01403664,9,"[""Computer network"",""Computer supported cooperative work"",""Distributed systems"",""Group communication"",""Minimum Steiner tree"",""Multicast routing""]",en,69,758,750,null,"[""53e9b029b7602d9703a854aa"",""53e9b9b4b7602d97045a56ff"",""53e9bba1b7602d97047ed621"",""557ce5906feeaa8086da3515"",""557f18fb6fee0fe990caec06"",""53e9bcd2b7602d970495563f"",""53e9a396b7602d9702ca2b15"",""53e99822b7602d9702044032"",""557e880d6fee0fe990caa50a"",""558a3c3684ae84d265bc6655"",""557db5adf6678c77ea21cb3a""]",A group multicast routing algorithm by using multiple minimum Steiner trees,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-3664(9700081-9"",""http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-3664(9700081-9"",""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140366497000819"",""https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031559621&partnerID=40&md5=47f32afec0ccab85591aea4a1f0c1b78""]","{""_id"":""539078f720f770854f5ab2fb"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Computer Communications"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Computer Communications"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",20,1997

 We study algorithms for clustering data that were recently proposed by Balcan, Blum and Gupta in SODA’09 [4] and that have
 already given rise to two follow-up papers. The input for the clustering problem consists of points in a metric space and
 a number k, specifying the desired number of clusters. The algorithms find a clustering that is provably close to a target clustering,
 provided that the instance has the “( 1 + α, ε-property”, which means that the instance is such that all solutions to the k-median problem for which the objective value is at most (1 + α times the optimal objective value correspond to clusterings that misclassify at most an ε fraction of the points with respect to the target clustering. We investigate the theoretical and practical implications of
 their results.
 
 
 Our main contributions are as follows. First, we show that instances that have the ( 1 + α, ε-property and for which, additionally, the clusters in the target clustering are large, are easier than general instances:
 the algorithm proposed in [4] is a constant factor approximation algorithm with an approximation guarantee that is better
 than the known hardness of approximation for general instances. Further, we show that it is NP-hard to check if an instance satisfies the ( 1 + α, ε-property for a given (α, ε; the algorithms in [4] need such α and ε as input parameters, however. We propose ways to use their algorithms even if we do not know values of α and ε for which the assumption holds. Finally, we implement these methods and other popular methods, and test them on real world
 data sets. We find that on these data sets there are no α and ε so that the dataset has both ( 1 + α, ε-property and sufficiently large clusters in the target solution. For the general case, we show that on our data sets the
 performance guarantee proved by [4] is meaningless for the values of α, ε such that the data set has the ( 1 + α, ε-property. The algorithm nonetheless gives reasonable results, although it is outperformed by other methods.

53e9998ab7602d97021ca292,"Nodes deployment is a major challenge to a successful implementation of radar sensor network (RSN. The goal of the deployment is to ensure that the target can achieve expected detection performance with high-energy efficiency. In this article, two deployment strategies, named Hexagonal Deployment Strategy (HDS and Diamond Deployment Strategy (DDS, are proposed to solve this problem. Each Radar Sensor (RS, separately, obtains probability of target detection depending on the position of RS according to the deployment strategies. To appraise these two deployment strategies, two decision fusion rules are derived over pass-loss fading channel in multi-hop RSN. We combine these two decision fusion rules with unfixed local detection performance. Simulations results show that given a finite number of RSs, our proposed strategies are far superior to Random Deployment Strategy in terms of detection probability and energy consumption to satisfy detection and false alarm requirements. The DDS achieves higher probability of detection and consumption fewer energy than HDS, no matter in decision fusion rules with Binary Transmission (BT or without Binary Transmission (NBT. The BT fusion rules performs better than NBT and the number of RS needed for expected detection performance is not the more the better. © 2013 Yang et al.","[{""_id"":""53f4d375dabfaeedd07810b2"",""bio"":null,""email"":""yangling891@126.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Ling Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Electrical Engineering,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,Chengdu,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4361c455f439fe4864b"",""orgs"":[""Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Elect Engn, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43164dabfaec22ba4b56d"",""bio"":null,""email"":""liangjing@uestc.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Jing Liang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0002-0860-6563"",""org"":""School of Electrical Engineering,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,Chengdu,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4361c455f439fe4864b"",""orgs"":[""Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Elect Engn, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4d2d3dabfaeedd27808a6"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Weiwei Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Electrical Engineering,University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,Chengdu,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4361c455f439fe4864b"",""orgs"":[""Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Elect Engn, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1186/1687-1499-2013-55,"[""Radar engineering details"",""Data mining"",""Software deployment"",""False alarm"",""Efficient energy use"",""Computer science"",""Fading"",""Fusion rules"",""Real-time computing"",""Energy consumption"",""Statistical power""]",,16871499,1,"[""decision fusion rules"",""energy efficiency"",""graphical deployment strategies"",""radar sensor networks"",""target detection""]",en,16,null,null,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/623/1861/1298/53e9998ab7602d97021ca292_0.pdf,"[""53e9b4f5b7602d9704020b89"",""53e99fc2b7602d970289cc80"",""53e9b5f4b7602d9704149e23"",""53e99bdcb7602d9702482f2e"",""53e9a8b0b7602d97031fbbe0"",""53e9aa2cb7602d970339bd58"",""558c68f4e4b00c3c48e2206e"",""53e9b71cb7602d97042b291b""]",Graphical deployment strategies in radar sensor networks (RSN for target detection.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1687-1499-2013-55"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1186/1687-1499-2013-55"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036f27cea80f954168665"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""EURASIP J.

 semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of all the signals in the closed system, and the system output is proved to converge
 to a small neighborhood of the origin. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the control scheme.","[{""_id"":""53f3985adabfae4b34a819ca"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c5e1cd8e14a34cc2f6"",""name"":""weisheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""xidian university"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2a91c455f439fe3d56d"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5602664b45cedb3395f87f49"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c5e1cd8e14a34cc2f6"",""name"":""chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""xidian university"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2a91c455f439fe3d56d"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5605cfc145cedb339670b472"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c5e1cd8e14a34cc2f6"",""name"":""junmin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""xidian university"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2a91c455f439fe3d56d"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2133715196""},{""_id"":""5605cfc145cedb339670b472"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c5e1cd8e14a34cc2f6"",""name"":""li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""xidian university"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2a91c455f439fe3d56d"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2133715196""}]",10.1007/s11633-008-0103-2,"[""Backstepping"",""Output feedback"",""Control theory"",""Nonlinear system"",""Control theory"",""Control engineering"",""Computer Applications"",""Engineering"",""Observer (quantum physics"",""Artificial neural network"",""Bounding overwatch""]",,17518520,1,"[""neural network nn"",""backstepping."",""nonlinear time-delay systems"",""adaptive"",""output-feedback"",""neural network(nn"",""neural network"",""closed system"",""design method"",""upper bound""]",en,32,108,103,null,"[""53e9b008b7602d9703a5edc6"",""53e9b86db7602d970443a83d"",""53e9b53bb7602d970406f7c1"",""53e9bde9b7602d9704a99a0c"",""558a7b75e4b0b32fcb371453"",""53e9b167b7602d9703bf0704"",""53e9af33b7602d970396dc4a"",""53e9af87b7602d97039cfbaf"",""53e9b699b7602d970420d423"",""53e9a4b9b7602d9702ddbd6f"",""53e9aaecb7602d970346cca1"",""53e9aa73b7602d97033e6839"",""53e9b0c2b7602d9703b381c1"",""53e9b8f5b7602d97044d7f26"",""53e9b40eb7602d9703f06037"",""557d3949f667eeed561996e2""]",Adaptive output-feedback regulation for nonlinear delayed systems using neural network,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11633-008-0103-2"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11633-008-0103-2"",""db/journals/ijautcomp/ijautcomp5.html#ChenL08"",""https://doi.org/10.1007/s11633-008-0103-2""]","{""_id"":""5390ad3020f70186a0ebc7da"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""International Journal of Automation and Computing"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":1}",5,2008
53e999a6b7602d97021ee3cb,"This paper investigates the delay-dependent stability of continuous-time fuzzy interconnected systems with time-varying delays. The fuzzy interconnected system consists of interconnected continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy subsystems. A stability criterion based on fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is proposed to guarantee the asymptotic stability of fuzzy time-delay interconnected systems. In the derivation process, some free fuzzy weighting matrices are introduced among the terms of the system equation to yield less conservative results. The proposed stability criterion can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities that are numerically feasible. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present method. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","[{""_id"":""53f447e8dabfaeecd69b2aa4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guanjie Yu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a44bedabfae646d546c62"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hongbin Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a5704dabfae646d552bcc"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiong Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f478eadabfaedf4368cc96"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Chuangyin Dang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1080/03081079.2013.810624,"[""Stability criterion"",""Weighting"",""Control theory"",""Delay dependent"",""Matrix (mathematics"",""Fuzzy logic"",""Exponential stability"",""Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system"",""Fuzzy associative matrix"",""Mathematics""]",null,15635104,7,"[""fuzzy interconnected systems"",""linear matrix inequalities (LMIs"",""stability"",""Takagi-Sugeno model"",""time-delay""]",en,8,753,739,,"[""53e9b3abb7602d9703e8d887"",""53e9a8dbb7602d9703228e92"",""53e9a60ab7602d9702f386b8"",""53e9a1f3b7602d9702af4be3"",""53e9ba54b7602d970466f8fa"",""53e9b2b1b7602d9703d579f8"",""53e9b3fdb7602d9703ef01cd"",""53e9a39eb7602d9702caf6ea"",""53e9a4ddb7602d9702dfeeb0"",""53e9a4a3b7602d9702dc1e45"",""558ba20584ae6766fdee5cf5"",""53e9a154b7602d9702a460b7"",""53e9a40eb7602d9702d2c5e5"",""53e9af87b7602d97039cf18d"",""56d91c3edabfae2eee816d65"",""53e99cafb7602d970256396a"",""53e9a178b7602d9702a6d322"",""53e99fa9b7602d9702882d3c"",""56d81927dabfae2eee875495"",""53e9a6e6b7602d970301bd57"",""53e99c3db7602d97024eabd0""]",New delay-dependent stability analysis for fuzzy time-delay interconnected systems.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03081079.2013.810624""]","{""_id"":""555036bf7cea80f954150acd"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Int.

53e999cab7602d970220df64,"Independent spanning trees (ISTs have increasing applications in fault-tolerance, bandwidth, and security. In this paper, we study the problem of parallel construction of ISTs on crossed cubes. We first propose the definitions of dimension-adjacent walk and dimension-adjacent tree along with a dimension property of crossed cubes. Then, we consider the parallel construction of ISTs on crossed cubes. We show that there exist n general dimension-adjacent trees which are independent of the addresses of vertices in the n-dimensional crossed cube CQn. Based on n dimension-adjacent trees and an arbitrary root vertex, a parallel algorithm with the time complexity O(2 n is proposed to construct n ISTs on CQn, where n ≥ 1. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

 of a cascade of multi-reach canals, each described by a pair of Saint-Venant equations. The weighted sum of entropies of the
 multi-reaches is adopted to construct the Lyapunov function. The time derivative of the Lyapunov function is expressed by
 the water depth variations at the gate boundaries, based on which a class of boundary feedback controllers is presented to
 guarantee the local asymptotic closed-loop stability. The advantage of this approach is that only the water level depths at
 the gate boundaries are measured as the feedback.","[{""_id"":""53f35ab2dabfae4b3496df7d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6ede1cd8e14a34deec2"",""name"":""Lihui Cen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0"",""orgs"":[""Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Automat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5429acdadabfaec7081a56af"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ygxi@sjtu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86b6ede1cd8e14a34deec2"",""name"":""Yugeng Xi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0"",""orgs"":[""Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Automat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-009-0108-7,"[""Lyapunov function"",""Lyapunov equation"",""Control theory"",""Control-Lyapunov function"",""Time derivative"",""Lyapunov redesign"",""Cascade"",""Feedback control"",""Lyapunov exponent"",""Mathematics""]",,18622836,7,"[""water level"",""lyapunov function"",""feedback control"",""saint venant equations""]",en,5,1164,1157,null,"[""53e99e7fb7602d9702746d61"",""53e9bbf0b7602d97048480a0"",""53e9bbadb7602d97047fb4d2"",""53e9a6bbb7602d9702fec529"",""53e9a31fb7602d9702c28d92""]",Lyapunov-based boundary feedback control in multi-reach canals,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-009-0108-7"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-009-0108-7"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b77cea80f95414b7df"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Science in China Series F: Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",52,2009

In this paper, a novel method of automatic skin lesion segmentation based on texture analysis and supervised learning is proposed. It firstly involve the clustering of training image into homogeneous regions using Mean-shift; then fusion texture feature are extracted from each clustered region based on Gabor and GLCM feature; next, the classifier model is generated through supervised learning base on LIBSVM; finally, lesion regions of the unseen image are automatically predicted out by produced classifier. Comprehensive experiments have been performed on a dataset of 125 dermoscopy images. The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods and results demonstrate that the presented method achieves both robust and accurate lesion segmentation in dermoscopy images.","[{""_id"":""53f49ab1dabfaedce5625dbc"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86af3de1cd8e14a316913a"",""name"":""Yingding He"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b41c455f439fe3da46"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f446b2dabfaeee229f89b1"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86af3de1cd8e14a316913a"",""name"":""Fengying Xie"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b41c455f439fe3da46"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-37444-9_26,"[""CAD"",""Computer vision"",""Skin lesion"",""Lesion"",""Pattern recognition"",""Computer science"",""Segmentation"",""Support vector machine"",""Supervised learning"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Classifier (linguistics"",""Cluster analysis""]",,16113349,2,"[""accurate lesion segmentation"",""novel method"",""glcm feature"",""automatic skin lesion segmentation"",""dermoscopy image"",""automatic skin lesion detection"",""supervised learning"",""cad crucially"",""lesion region"",""texture analysis"",""state-of-the-art method""]",en,4,341,330,null,"[""557de0db6fee0fe990ca52ea"",""558a8b28e4b0b32fcb377115"",""558a7342e4b031bae1f7b621"",""53e99822b7602d970204503f"",""558ae89e84ae84d265c059ac"",""53e9b310b7602d9703dd909e"",""558be288e4b00c3c48df0967"",""53e9a1d5b7602d9702acd549"",""53e9b587b7602d97040c7931"",""53e9b1b6b7602d9703c43219"",""53e99c75b7602d970252a1ee"",""53e9a7f1b7602d9703135431"",""53e9afe9b7602d9703a3f14c""]",Automatic skin lesion segmentation based on texture analysis and supervised learning,"[""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875909446""]","{""_id"":""54824c66582fc50b5e008eb0"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Asian Conference on Computer Vision"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7725,2013

 on the basis of the neural finite impulse response (FIR filter, decision feedback architecture and the characteristic of
 the Laguerre filter. They are neural FIR adaptive decision feedback equalizer (SNNDFE and neural FIR adaptive Laguerre equalizer
 (LSNN. Of these two equalizers, the latter is simple and with characteristics of both infinite impulse response (IIR and
 FIR filters; it can use shorter memory length to obtain better performance. As confirmed by theoretical analysis, the novel
 LSNN equalizer is stable (0 a<1. Furthermore, simulation results show that the SNNDFE can get better equalized performance than SNN equalizer, while the
 latter exhibits better performance than others in terms of convergence speed, mean square error (MSE and bit error rate (BER.
 Therefore, it can reduce the input dimension and eliminate linear and nonlinear interference effectively. In addition, it
 is very suitable for hardware implementation due to its simple structure.","[{""_id"":""53f44d22dabfaee43ec98802"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hqzhao0815@yahoo.com.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Haiquan Zhao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest Jiaotong University Key Laboratory of Signal and Information Processing of Sichuan Province Chengdu 610031 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3761c455f439fe430dd"",""orgs"":[""SW Jiaotong Univ, Key Lab Signal & Informat Proc Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5440d2d9dabfae805a6fc10d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jiashu Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest Jiaotong University Key Laboratory of Signal and Information Processing of Sichuan Province Chengdu 610031 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3761c455f439fe430dd"",""orgs"":[""SW Jiaotong Univ, Key Lab Signal & Informat Proc Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-009-0148-z,"[""Nonlinear system"",""Laguerre polynomials"",""Control theory"",""Computer science"",""Infinite impulse response"",""Mean squared error"",""Adaptive equalizer"",""Interference (wave propagation"",""Finite impulse response"",""Bit error rate""]",,18622836,10,"[""nonlinear distortion"",""communication system"",""finite impulse response"",""adaptive equalizer"",""mean square error"",""fir filter"",""infinite impulse response"",""bit error rate""]",en,0,1890,1881,null,"[""557ee0e3d19faf961d16d24e"",""53e9afdab7602d9703a2adc7"",""53e9ba94b7602d97046ba6db"",""53e9a3c7b7602d9702cd639a"",""557d47bbf667eeed5619a220"",""53e99beab7602d9702492471"",""53e9a5a1b7602d9702ece0da"",""53e9b6d0b7602d970425ca43""]",Neural FIR adaptive Laguerre equalizer with a gradient adaptive amplitude for nonlinear channel in communication systems,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-009-0148-z"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-009-0148-z"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b77cea80f95414b7df"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Science in China Series F: Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",52,2009
53e999aeb7602d97021f51aa,"This paper addresses the problem of parts scheduling in a cellular manufacturing system (CMS by considering exceptional parts
 processed on machines located in multiple cells. To optimize the scheduling of parts as well as to minimize material handling
 between cells, the practice has to develop processing sequences for the parts in cells. A commonly chosen objective is to
 find part sequences within cells which results in a minimum tardiness. This paper proposes a nonlinear mathematical programming
 model of the problem by minimizing the total weighted tardiness in a CMS. To solve the mathematical model, a scatter search
 approach is developed, in which the common components of scatter search are redefined and redesigned so as to better fit the
 problem. This scatter search approach considers two different methods to generate diverse initial solutions and two improvement
 methods, and adopts the roulette wheel selection in the combination method to further expand the conceptual framework and
 implementation of the scatter search. The proposed approach is compared with the commercial solver CPLEX on a set of test
 problems, some of which are large dimensions. Computational results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this scatter search
 approach.","[{""_id"":""53f460a4dabfaee4dc836fb1"",""bio"":null,""email"":""jftang@mail.neu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86b129e1cd8e14a3241f29"",""name"":""Jiafu Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern University (NEU Department of Systems Engineering, Key Lab of Integrated Automation of Process Industry of MOE Shenyang Liaoning 110004 People’s Republic of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c91c455f439fe3e3e5"",""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Dept Syst Engn, Key Lab Integrated Automat Proc Ind, MOE, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5406e82edabfae92b422949a"",""bio"":null,""email"":""xqwang001@gmail.com"",""gid"":""5b86b129e1cd8e14a3241f29"",""name"":""Xiaoqing Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern University (NEU Department of Systems Engineering, Key Lab of Integrated Automation of Process Industry of MOE Shenyang Liaoning 110004 People’s Republic of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c91c455f439fe3e3e5"",""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Dept Syst Engn, Key Lab Integrated Automat Proc Ind, MOE, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43702dabfaeb2ac058548"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86c59de1cd8e14a3b76c0c"",""name"":""Iko Kaku"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Akita Prefectural University Department of Management Science and Engineering Honjo Japan"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b41d1c455f439fe47b3d"",""orgs"":[""Akita Prefectural Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Honjo, Japan""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46454dabfaeee22a4bf3a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869868e1cd8e14a37fe28d"",""name"":""Kai-leung Yung"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""The Polytechnic University of Hong Kong Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering Hung Hom Kowloon Hong Kong"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2961c455f439fe3ce46"",""orgs"":[""Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s10845-008-0236-8,"[""Mathematical optimization"",""Tardiness"",""Cellular manufacturing"",""Scheduling (computing"",""Improvement methods"",""Fitness proportionate selection"",""The Conceptual Framework"",""Solver"",""Engineering"",""Combination method""]",,15728145,4,"[""Cellular manufacturing"",""Parts scheduling"",""Exceptional parts"",""Scatter search""]",en,30,537,525,null,"[""53e9a178b7602d9702a69f14"",""53e9a2ceb7602d9702bd8b34"",""53e9bbf0b7602d97048487f5"",""53e9b22db7602d9703cc5870"",""53e9b54fb7602d97040862dc"",""53e99b36b7602d97023d7bd8"",""53e99f20b7602d97027ed100"",""53e9b6fab7602d9704290a1a"",""53e9a9b7b7602d97033128c2"",""53e9b775b7602d970431d583"",""53e9a408b7602d9702d20fc1"",""53e9b1a3b7602d9703c3171e"",""53e9a9b0b7602d970330daff""]",Optimization of parts scheduling in multiple cells considering intercell move using scatter search approach,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10845-008-0236-8"",""http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10845-008-0236-8"",""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10845-008-0236-8"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036cf7cea80f954158d38"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""J.

53e99984b7602d97021c7ed9,"In a WLAN setting, the system throughput may be heavily affected by a small number of low data rate clients due to the packet-fairness property provided by IEEE 802.11 DCF. This is regarded as the performance anomaly problem. Client relay is a technology widely adopted to solve this problem. An important issue of client relay is to decide when a client's traffic should be relayed and who relays it. However, the existing protocols fail to consider the overhead introduced by DCF contentions, resulting in an inaccurate performance analysis and lead to wrong decisions for client relay. In this paper, we focus on the performance analysis for multi-hop relay networks with consideration of contention overhead of relay nodes in IEEE 802.11 DCF protocols. The main work of this paper includes: 1 we consider the contention overhead in the performance analytical model of collaborative relay networks. This model is more accurate than the existing models. 2 We present a throughput analytical model that considers different traffic demands of clients for the traffic pattern of relay networks. Extensive simulations have been done in NS-2. The simulation results show that our algorithm is more accurate and achieves higher relay performance, compared with existing methods. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","[{""_id"":""53f495c3dabfaeb4c277b8d3"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b71be1cd8e14a34f2679"",""name"":""Zhang Bo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4c71c455f439fe4c748"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""548d7413dabfaed7b5fa486e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b71be1cd8e14a34f2679"",""name"":""Jia Xiaohua"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4c71c455f439fe4c748"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1109/TCOMM.2012.022513.120041,"[""Relay channel"",""Airfield traffic pattern"",""IEEE 802.11"",""Computer network"",""Hop (networking"",""Engineering"",""Throughput"",""Low data rate"",""Relay"",""Link Access Procedure for Frame Relay""]",,00906778,2,"[""client relay"",""cooperative communications"",""Performance anomaly""]",en,18,540,532,null,"[""53e9a232b7602d9702b3a995"",""53e9af7bb7602d97039c228e"",""56d88948dabfae2eeea84b67"",""53e9a886b7602d97031d642c"",""53e9b115b7602d9703b92d6a"",""56d8144bdabfae2eee670d1f"",""53e99c3db7602d97024ed560"",""53e9ae8ab7602d97038ad108"",""53e9a806b7602d970314579e"",""53e9a8eab7602d970323b6f4"",""53e99bb1b7602d9702458781"",""53e9a75fb7602d970309797b"",""53e9ba45b7602d9704658b51"",""53e99f09b7602d97027d4b19"",""53e998f0b7602d970212fe8d"",""53e99b21b7602d97023bad43"",""53e9b195b7602d9703c1ecb5"",""53e9b2f0b7602d9703dac4a4"",""53e999d2b7602d9702216e5c""]",Multi-hop collaborative relay networks with consideration of contention overhead of relay nodes in IEEE 802.11 DCF,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2012.022513.120041"",""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6473970"",""https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874906265&doi=10.1109%2fTCOMM.2012.022513.120041&partnerID=40&md5=27910120ac765f2c7ccdbebf3b35d6e8""]","{""_id"":""53a7315420f7420be8d391bd"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""IEEE Transactions on Communications"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IEEE Transactions on Communications"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",61,2013
53e99998b7602d97021dfa7f,"In lowlight conditions, images taken by phone cameras usually have too much noise, while images taken using a flash have a high signal-noise ratio (SNR and look unnatural. This paper proposes a novel imaging method using flash/no-flash image pairs. Through transferring the natural tone of the former to the latter, the resulting image has a high SNR and maintains a natural appearance. For realtime implementation, we use two preview images, which are taken with and without flash, to estimate the transformation function in advance. Then we use this function to adjust the tone of the image captured with flash in real time. Thus, the method does not require a frame memory and it is suitable for cell phone cameras.

53e999c3b7602d97022083f3,"The packet-pair technique is the most popular end-based approach for bandwidth measurement. Most packet-pair based proposals use the fluid cross-traffic model to justify the design of their estimation techniques. However, real traffic is certainly not fluid. The consistency of the statistical packet-pair dispersion model in general bursty cross-traffic conditions has still not been fully justified in published research. Furthermore, we note that existing measurement techniques do not take account of the actual measurement variance, which means that they are often subject to significant fluctuations in accuracy. To achieve high accuracy and efficiency in available bandwidth measurement, we contribute analytical insights into packet-pair dispersion techniques by developing a queuing model to describe the impact of the cross-traffic on the packet-pair dispersion under bursty cross-traffic conditions. Based on this model, the consistency of statistical packet-pair dispersion measurement in general cross-traffic conditions is demonstrated and new approaches that help to detect and eliminate the elastic bias caused by measurement variance are presented. We show that the algorithm we developed works correctly on the Internet and offers more dependable measurement results than existing tools.","[{""_id"":""54457498dabfae862da1e67f"",""bio"":null,""email"":""a-7@163.com"",""gid"":""5b86c4b7e1cd8e14a3b10f18"",""name"":""Jun Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Hunan University School of Computer Science and Communication Changsha China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2ae1c455f439fe3d7a3"",""orgs"":[""Hunan Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Commun, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a4fa4dabfae646d54d2ec"",""bio"":null,""email"":""a-7@163.com"",""gid"":""5b8694e0e1cd8e14a368a710"",""name"":""Dafang Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Hunan University School of Software Changsha China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2ae1c455f439fe3d7a3"",""orgs"":[""Hunan Univ, Sch Software, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11235-009-9145-1,"[""Dispersion (optics"",""Computer science"",""Computer communication networks"",""Real-time computing"",""Queueing theory"",""Bandwidth measurement"",""Computer engineering"",""The Internet""]",,15729451,3,"[""Computer network"",""Available bandwidth"",""Measurement variance"",""Traffic burst""]",en,6,227,211,null,"[""53e999e7b7602d970222a687"",""53e9bd50b7602d97049e3578"",""53e9b2c6b7602d9703d732db"",""558a3594e4b037c08755c935"",""53e99d13b7602d97025cb58e"",""53e9a4cfb7602d9702ded37e"",""558a2ed3e4b0b32fcb354dfa"",""558b373f84ae84d265c22171"",""53e9be1bb7602d9704ad6cce"",""53e99c20b7602d97024cb1c4"",""53e9a374b7602d9702c7ec64"",""53e99cfdb7602d97025b11ac"",""53e9b31bb7602d9703de5cec"",""56d8a5d6dabfae2eee8aade8"",""573696816e3b12023e58cee8"",""53e9bb3db7602d970477cd54"",""53e9aee4b7602d9703911244"",""53e9ae84b7602d97038a5199"",""53e9ba32b7602d9704641d2d""]",Toward accurate and efficient available bandwidth measurement,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11235-009-9145-1"",""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2726369.2726813&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=686251007&CFTOKEN=69778812&preflayout=flat"",""http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11235-009-9145-1"",""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11235-009-9145-1"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""53907df320f770854f610657"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Telecommunication Systems"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",41,2009

 In addition, two fault decision criteria are defined to conduct fault identification. To overcome the difficulty in determining
 model parameters accurately and subjectively, a nonlinear optimization model is constructed and the optimal parameters are
 obtained. Two experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results show that

53e999bbb7602d97022040b7,"This paper presents a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm to solve multi-objective multicast routing problems in telecommunication networks. The algorithm combines simulated annealing based strategies and a genetic local search, aiming at a more flexible and effective exploration and exploitation in the search space of the complex problem to find more non-dominated solutions in the Pareto Front. Due to the complex structure of the multicast tree, crossover and mutation operators have been specifically devised concerning the features and constraints in the problem. A new adaptive mutation probability based on simulated annealing is proposed in the hybrid algorithm to adaptively adjust the mutation rate according to the fitness of the new solution against the average quality of the current population during the evolution procedure. Two simulated annealing based search direction tuning strategies are applied to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the hybrid evolutionary algorithm. Simulations have been carried out on some benchmark multi-objective multicast routing instances and a large amount of random networks with five real world objectives including cost, delay, link utilisations, average delay and delay variation in telecommunication networks. Experimental results demonstrate that both the simulated annealing based strategies and the genetic local search within the proposed multi-objective algorithm, compared with other multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, can efficiently identify high quality non-dominated solution set for multi-objective multicast routing problems and outperform other conventional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in the literature. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","[{""_id"":""560e703a45cedb3397676cf4"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hnxy@hnu.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Ying Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""College of Information Science and Engineering,Hunan University,Changsha,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2ae1c455f439fe3d7a3"",""orgs"":[""Hunan Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f38640dabfae4b34a14ca8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Rong Qu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0001-8318-7509"",""org"":""The Automated Scheduling, Optimisation and Planning (ASAP Group, School of Computer Science,The University of Nottingham,Nottingham,UK"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4bf1c455f439fe4c3d5"",""orgs"":[""Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, Automated Scheduling Optimisat & Planning ASAP Gr, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54055a1ddabfae92b41c839f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Renfa Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""College of Information Science and Engineering,Hunan University,Changsha,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2ae1c455f439fe3d7a3"",""orgs"":[""Hunan Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s10479-013-1322-7,"[""Simulated annealing"",""Hill climbing"",""Mathematical optimization"",""Hybrid algorithm"",""Evolutionary algorithm"",""Computer science"",""Multi-objective optimization"",""Adaptive simulated annealing"",""Local search (optimization"",""Multicast""]",,15729338,1,"[""multi-objective genetic local search"",""multicast routing"",""simulated annealing""]",en,21,555,527,null,"[""53e9a6c3b7602d9702ff85cc"",""558c19cce4b00c3c48e03c4f"",""5582d26c0cf2fcbbc5f1d565"",""53e9b2bfb7602d9703d6b7c4"",""53e9b240b7602d9703cde58c"",""53e9a15bb7602d9702a4e36d"",""53e9a5dbb7602d9702f06c47"",""53e99a74b7602d97022e6c77"",""558a7aebe4b0b32fcb371130"",""53e99fd0b7602d97028a98e2"",""53e9a749b7602d97030802b8"",""53e9a3e7b7602d9702cfb178"",""53e9b7d3b7602d9704383a03"",""53e9be03b7602d9704ab4ebf"",""53e9b512b7602d9704045694"",""53e9a114b7602d9702a054a7"",""557ce5906feeaa8086da3515"",""558a478ee4b0b32fcb35e192"",""53e9a264b7602d9702b6d766"",""53e9a500b7602d9702e1fcf1"",""53e9b2b1b7602d9703d5a5ca"",""558c076084ae6766fdf0a46f"",""53e998e8b7602d97021236ca"",""53e9a3dbb7602d9702cec3d8"",""53e9a797b7602d97030d0f8b"",""53e9a060b7602d9702948ef1"",""53e9af53b7602d9703996dc8"",""53e9b43db7602d9703f3826a"",""53e9ad04b7602d97036e31c8"",""53e9a53fb7602d9702e6198f"",""53e99822b7602d9702044032"",""53e9b693b7602d970420876d"",""53e99a67b7602d97022d510e"",""53e9af5ab7602d970399da9c"",""53e9b7adb7602d97043547e3"",""53e9a7d6b7602d97031183b5"",""53e99c83b7602d9702532fbb"",""53e9a84fb7602d970319afa1""]",A simulated annealing based genetic local search algorithm for multi-objective multicast routing problems.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-013-1322-7"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10479-013-1322-7"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036c47cea80f954153a45"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Annals OR"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",206,2013

53e99976b7602d97021ba8ca,"Human faces can be arranged into different face categories using information from common visual cues such as gender, ethnicity, and age. It has been demonstrated that using face categorization as a precursor step to face recognition improves recognition rates and leads to more graceful errors. Although face categorization using common visual cues yields meaningful face categories, developing accurate and robust gender, ethnicity, and age categorizers is a challenging issue. Moreover, it limits the overall number of possible face categories and, in practice, yields unbalanced face categories which can compromise recognition performance. This paper investigates ways to automatically discover a categorization of human faces from a collection of unlabeled face images without relying on predefined visual cues. Specifically, given a set of face images from a group of known individuals (i.e., gallery set, our goal is finding ways to robustly partition the gallery set (i.e., face categories. The objective is being able to assign novel images of the same individuals (i.e., query set to the correct face category with high accuracy and robustness. To address the issue of face category discovery, we represent faces using local features and apply unsupervised learning (i.e., clustering. To categorize faces in novel images, we employ nearest-neighbor algorithms or learn the separating boundaries between face categories using supervised learning (i.e., classification. To improve face categorization robustness, we allow face categories to share local features as well as to overlap. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach through extensive experiments and comparisons using the FERET database. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","[{""_id"":""53f4349edabfaee4dc7724d9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Shicai Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42d37dabfaee1c0a30fb2"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""George Bebis"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5630045e45cedb33998c8a43"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Muhammad Hussain"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5433a216dabfaeb4c6ac4ca5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ghulam Muhammad"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f641e8dabfae0f353fa719"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Anwar M.

However, credentials endure all kinds of attacks during the transport while credentials bring us a lot of benefits. At the same time, how to store credentials is still a key problem,to manage,trust management systems. Good credential-storage design can greatly reduce much overhead, such as easy to search credentials, less storage space, high application convenience and so on.

53e99a3cb7602d97022987aa,"When deploying two-tier LTE cellular networks with coexistence of macrocells and underlaid femtocells, the strategies of spectrum arrangement need to be investigated to efficiently utilize the scarce spectrum resource. Co-channel spectrum usage and dedicated-channel spectrum usage are two traditional strategies of spectrum arrangement. Nevertheless, there are pros and cons of them from the perspective of achievable network capacity in two-tier LTE network as they result in different amounts of available spectrum at each tier and disparate cross-tier interferences. To improve overall spectrum utilization, we propose a novel approach of spectrum arrangement, which is called hybrid spectrum arrangement, to take advantage of their merits. In our proposal, an underlaid femtocell can select its spectrum usage mode according to a criterion aiming to benefit both macrocell and femtocell in terms of achieved capacities. Consequently, the femtocells embedded in macrocell are self-organized as inner and outer femtocells, which operate in dedicated-channel spectrum usage and co-channel spectrum usage, respectively. Then, we examine distinct characteristics of cross-tier interferences in the context of hybrid spectrum arrangement and present corresponding schemes to mitigate the residual significant interferences. Analysis and system level simulation are given to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods for two-tier LTE cellular network. © 2013 Bai and Chen.","[{""_id"":""542abe5edabfae646d5843e7"",""bio"":null,""email"":""bai@hainu.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Yong Bai"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""College of Information Science & Technology,Hainan University,Hainan,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b47e1c455f439fe4a5b6"",""orgs"":[""Hainan Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54067ddbdabfae44f0838403"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lan Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""DOCOMO Beijing Communications Laboratories Co., Ltd,Haidian District,P.

53e99a20b7602d9702277682,"In this paper we propose an efficient Fair Exchange Signature Scheme (FESS that allows two players to exchange digital signatures in a fair way. It may be considered as an interesting extension of concurrent signature presented in EUROCRYPT 2004 that is constructed from ring signatures. In our scheme, two unwakened signatures signed separately by two participants can be verified easily by the other player, but it would not go into effect until an extra piece of commitment keystone is released by one of the players. Once the keystone revealed, two signatures are both aroused and become effective. A key feature of the proposed scheme is that two players can exchange digital signatures simultaneously through a secret commitment keystone without involvement of any Trusted Third Party. Moreover, the efficiency of our signature scheme is higher than that of concurrent signature.","[{""_id"":""56027b1445cedb3395fb0f75"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jingwei Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5447fbd1dabfae87b7dbb700"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Rong Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45d93dabfaefedbb6919f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wenping Ma"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ying Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5429ff58dabfae646d531573"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xinmei Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-010-0065-1,"[""Trusted third party"",""Computer security"",""Computer science"",""Ring signature"",""Digital signature"",""Schnorr signature""]",,18622836,5,"[""efficient fair exchange signature"",""concurrent signature"",""unwakened signature"",""schnorr signature"",""ring signature"",""fess"",""trusted third party"",""signature scheme"",""proposed scheme"",""secret commitment keystone"",""electronic commerce"",""fair ex- change"",""fair exchange signature schemes"",""commitment keystone"",""digital signature"",""application software"",""digital signatures"",""computer science education"",""computer networks"",""information security"",""protocols"",""internet""]",en,7,953,945,null,"[""53e9a515b7602d9702e3a6ae"",""557d15296feeaa8086da63a7"",""53e9a704b7602d970303a6b7"",""53e9bb72b7602d97047b319e"",""53e9bb44b7602d97047848c7"",""5c89175f4895d9cbc6aee76d"",""53e9a95eb7602d97032b88c4"",""53e99f70b7602d9702847921"",""53e9addbb7602d97037e2351"",""53e9ab07b7602d970348c2e6"",""53e9b2dbb7602d9703d8d460"",""5c7866b94895d9cbc69a6bb8"",""53e9a081b7602d9702967b4a"",""53e99b26b7602d97023c03a0"",""53e9ab00b7602d9703484ba0"",""599c7d32601a182cd280958a"",""53e9bd46b7602d97049d6af5"",""53e9b131b7602d9703bb3b42"",""53e9abf1b7602d97035ae156"",""53e9a9f0b7602d9703358291"",""53e9b9bab7602d97045b07bf"",""53e9b532b7602d970406b092"",""53e9b20cb7602d9703ca16a4""]",Fair Exchange Signature Schemes,"[""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77952320773"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""54825983582fc50b5e12959e"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Science in China, Series F: Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":11}",53,2010

Taking all kinds of static constraints into account, these methods realized the path planning in the planning space, achieved the swarms' evasion to the fixed threat. The track data smooth processing was done so that it can be used in the fly. The methods of swarms' behavior control can realize the evasion to the emergent threat or obstacles and response real-timely to the coming attacker target. The simulation results show that the swarm transport path planning method and the swarm convoy behavior control method are feasible.

53e99a1ab7602d970226f684,"Vector quantization (VQ using exhaustive nearest neighbor (NN search is the speed bottleneck in classic bag of visual words (BOV models. Approximate NN (ANN search methods still cost great time in VQ, since they check multiple regions in the search space to reduce VQ errors. In this paper, we propose ExVQ, an exclusive NN search method to speed up BOV models. Given a visual descriptor, a portion of search regions is excluded from the whole search space by a linear projection. We ensure that minimal VQ errors are introduced in the exclusion by learning an accurate classifier. Multiple exclusions are organized in a tree structure in ExVQ, whose VQ speed and VQ error rate can be reliably estimated. We show that ExVQ is much faster than state-of-the-art ANN methods in BOV models while maintaining almost the same classification accuracy. In addition, we empirically show that even with the VQ error rate as high as 30%, the classification accuracy of some ANN methods, including ExVQ, is similar to that of exhaustive search (which has zero VQ error. In some cases, ExVQ has even higher classification accuracy than the exhaustive search.","[{""_id"":""542ad53fdabfae2b4e14a8ac"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c9bf7"",""name"":""Yu Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8a8"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4ae71dabfaeb22f57609a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c9bf7"",""name"":""Jianxin Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8a8"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""562b045545cedb3398963955"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6dbe1cd8e14a34d6109"",""name"":""Weiyao Lin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-37331-2_31,"[""k-nearest neighbors algorithm"",""Brute-force search"",""Bag-of-words model in computer vision"",""Pattern recognition"",""Word error rate"",""Vector quantization"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Tree structure"",""Quantization (signal processing"",""Classifier (linguistics"",""Mathematics""]",,16113349,1,"[""vq speed"",""vq error"",""exclusive visual descriptor quantization"",""exhaustive search"",""search region"",""bov model"",""classification accuracy"",""vq error rate"",""search method"",""minimal vq error"",""exclusive nn search method""]",en,2,421,408,null,"[""53e9bcdab7602d9704962cda"",""53e9ae89b7602d97038a7b16"",""53e9b9c1b7602d97045b43dc"",""558b413184ae84d265c25aeb"",""53e9bac9b7602d97046f55f1"",""53e99c7cb7602d970252a49c"",""53e9b9e7b7602d97045e36b5"",""53e9b641b7602d970419b955"",""53e99a98b7602d9702313574"",""53e9b7d9b7602d970438c4f0"",""53e9aa80b7602d97033f982b"",""53e9b008b7602d9703a5eda5"",""53e9acd3b7602d97036b022f"",""53e9ba94b7602d97046b9e43"",""53e9ac7bb7602d970364ebc0"",""558bda9984ae6766fdef9e1a"",""53e9b57cb7602d97040bdd6d"",""53e9a011b7602d97028f6556"",""53e9aadfb7602d97034623f3"",""53e9a767b7602d97030a1b9f"",""53e99c43b7602d97024f09da"",""53e9a1bcb7602d9702ab289b"",""53e9ba59b7602d970467476b"",""558ab45be4b0b32fcb385ee0"",""53e9a48eb7602d9702daa5ae"",""558aebdf84ae84d265c06d17""]",Exclusive visual descriptor quantization,"[""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84875877457""]","{""_id"":""54824c66582fc50b5e008eb0"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Asian Conference on Computer Vision"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7724,2013

A weighted voting scheme is also proposed to secure the P2P system by declining the join request from malicious peers. TIM is scalable and efficient in that: (1 it is com- pletely distributed without a central server; (2 it dynam- ically manages the price and service by integrating valu- ables of pricing, trust, and incentive.

53e999e0b7602d9702228f57,"Compressive sensing enables quite lower sampling rate compared with Nyquist sampling. As long as the signal is sparsity in some basis, the random sampling with CS can be employed. In order to make CS applied in the practice, the Analog to Information Converter (AIC should be involved. Based on the Limited Random Sequence (LRS modulation, the AIC with LRS can be designed with high performance according to the fixed sparsity. However, if the sparsity of the signal varies with time, the original AIC with LRS is not efficient. In this paper, the adaptive AIC which adapts its scheme of LRS according to the variation of the sparsity is proposed and the prototype system is designed. Due to the adaption of the AIC with the scheme of LRS, the sampling rate can be further reduced. The simulation results confirm the performance of the proposed adaptive AIC scheme. The prototype system can successfully fulfil the random sampling and adapt to the variation of sparsity, which verify and consolidate the validity and feasibility for the future implementation of adaptive AIC on chip.

53e99a0ab7602d970225791e,"Recently, more and more approaches are emerging to solve the cross-view matching problem where reference samples and query samples are from different views. In this paper, inspired by Graph Embedding, we propose a unified framework for these cross-view methods called Cross-view Graph Embedding. The proposed framework can not only reformulate most traditional cross-view methods (e.g., CCA, PLS and CDFE, but also extend the typical single-view algorithms (e.g., PCA, LDA and LPP to cross-view editions. Furthermore, our general framework also facilitates the development of new cross-view methods. In this paper, we present a new algorithm named Cross-view Local Discriminant Analysis (CLODA under the proposed framework. Different from previous cross-view methods only preserving inter-view discriminant information or the intra-view local structure, CLODA preserves the local structure and the discriminant information of both intra-view and inter-view. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our algorithms on two cross-view face recognition problems: face recognition across poses and face recognition across resolutions. These real-world face recognition experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves impressive performance in the cross-view problems.","[{""_id"":""5434146ddabfaeb43f2b4374"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86a6a0e1cd8e14a3de81e4"",""name"":""Zhiwu Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b8461c455f439fe5ee78"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4bbc5dabfaeda9877b436"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868cd6e1cd8e14a3354398"",""name"":""Shiguang Shan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b8461c455f439fe5ee78"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4c88bdabfaedce56648c2"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869380e1cd8e14a35fa67d"",""name"":""Haihong Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""OMRON Social Solutions Co.

53e99a0eb7602d970225f63e,"Algorithmic tools for graphs of small treewidth are used to address questions in com- plexity theory. For both arithmetic and Boolean circuits, it is shown that any circuit of size n O(1 and treewidth O(log i n can be simulated by a circuit of width O(log i+1 n and size n c , where c = O(1, if i = 0, and c = O(loglogn otherwise. For our main construction, we prove that multiplicatively disjoint arithmetic circuits of size n O(1 and treewidth k can be simulated by bounded fan-in arithmetic formulas of depth O(k 2 logn. From this we derive the analogous statement for syntactically multilinear arithmetic circuits, which strengthens the central theorem of (MR08. As another application, we derive that constant width arith- metic circuits of size n O(1 can be balanced to depth O(logn, provided certain restrictions are made on the use of iterated multiplication. Also from our main construction, we derive that Boolean bounded fan-in circuits of size n O(1 and treewidth k can be simulated by bounded fan-in formulas of depth O(k 2 logn. This strengthens in the non-uniform setting the known inclusion that SC 0 ⊆ NC 1 . Finally, we apply our construction to show that reachability for directed graphs of bounded treewidth is in LogDCFL.","[{""_id"":""53f79328dabfae8faa49ae90"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86be5ee1cd8e14a383c211"",""name"":""Maurice J.

53e99a35b7602d9702291fb8,"Multi-agent systems arise from diverse fields in natural and artificial systems, and a basic problem is to understand how
 locally interacting agents lead to collective behaviors (e.g., synchronization of the overall system. In this paper, we will
 consider a basic class of multi-agent systems that are described by a simplification of the well-known Vicsek model. This
 model looks simple, but the rigorous theoretical analysis is quite complicated, because there are strong nonlinear interactions
 among the agents in the model. In fact, most of the existing results on synchronization need to impose a certain connectivity
 condition on the global behaviors of the agents’ trajectories (or on the closed-loop dynamic neighborhood graphs, which are
 quite hard to verify in general. In this paper, by introducing a probabilistic framework to this problem, we will provide
 a complete and rigorous proof for the fact that the overall multi-agent system will synchronize with large probability as
 long as the number of agents is large enough. The proof is based on a detailed analysis of both the dynamical properties of
 the nonlinear system evolution and the asymptotic properties of the spectrum of random geometric graphs.","[{""_id"":""53f43a42dabfaee4dc7a6a19"",""bio"":null,""email"":""Lguo@amss.ac.cn"",""gid"":""5b869da0e1cd8e14a3a3cdf5"",""name"":""Gongguo Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0002-7879-1338"",""org"":""Chinese Academy of Sciences Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science Beijing 100080 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29f1c455f439fe3d25c"",""orgs"":[""Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5429bf41dabfaec7081afcb1"",""bio"":null,""email"":""Lguo@amss.ac.cn"",""gid"":""5b869da0e1cd8e14a3a3cdf5"",""name"":""Lei Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Chinese Academy of Sciences Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science Beijing 100080 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29f1c455f439fe3d25c"",""orgs"":[""Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11424-007-9016-3,"[""Convergence (routing"",""Complex system"",""Spectral graph theory"",""Nonlinear system"",""Multi-agent system"",""Theoretical computer science"",""Voltage graph"",""Graph theory"",""Synchronization"",""Mathematical optimization"",""Graph energy"",""Dynamical systems theory"",""Random geometric graph"",""Mathematics""]",,15597067,2,"[""nonlinear system"",""random geometric graph"",""spectrum"",""collective behavior"",""multi agent system"",""spectral graph theory""]",en,61,197,173,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1871/2005/916/53e99a35b7602d9702291fb8_0.pdf,"[""53e99e78b7602d970273a1fe"",""53e99a35b7602d9702291fb8"",""53e9a691b7602d9702fc6739"",""53e99a30b7602d970228f506"",""53e9b403b7602d9703ef2b54"",""53e9a751b7602d97030870f5""]",Convergence of a Class of Multi-Agent Systems In Probabilistic Framework.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11424-007-9016-3"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434274"",""https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2007.4434274"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11424-007-9016-3"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036ef7cea80f954166eac"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""J.

It is shown that E-array can be constructed by complementary arrays, which mean pairs of arrays that the sum of each aperiodic autocorrelation function at the same phase shifts takes zero at any shift except zero shift, as well as the one-dimensional case. It is also shown that the number of mates of E-array with which the cross correlation function between E-arrays takes zero at any even shifts is equal to the dimension. Furthermore it is investigated that E-array possesses good aperiodic autocorrelation that the rate of zero cor-relation values to array length approaches one as the dimension becomes large.

53e99a35b7602d9702295d5d,"This paper is concerned with the quantized synchronization control problem of coupled dynamic networks (CDNs with communication constraints. The networked-induced delay, data packet dropouts, and signal quantization effects are simultaneously considered in the synchronization controller design. A new closed-loop coupled dynamic system is constructed, where both the interval time-varying delays and quantized parameters are taken into account. By using Kronecker product technique and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, a stability criterion is obtained for the closed-loop CDNs, which also guarantees that the CDNs are synchronized. Then, both the networked controller and the quantized parameters can be designed. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","[{""_id"":""53f49c4cdabfaedce5627ddd"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hgt820112@163.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Guotao Hui"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4359ddabfaeb2ac04c77b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Bonan Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4702cdabfaedd74e9036b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yingchun Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42ef7dabfaec22ba2c357"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiangping Meng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110004, Liaoning, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s12559-013-9203-6,"[""Stability criterion"",""Synchronization"",""Control theory"",""Kronecker product"",""Functional approach"",""Computer science"",""Control theory"",""Network packet"",""Real-time computing"",""Quantization (physics"",""Quantization (signal processing""]",,18669964,2,"[""Coupled dynamic networks (CDNs"",""Time-delay"",""Packet dropouts"",""Signal quantization""]",en,2,206,200,null,"[""53e9b495b7602d9703f9dacd"",""53e9b5f4b7602d9704148728"",""53e99db1b7602d970266e91a"",""53e9b3a3b7602d9703e85208"",""53e9a987b7602d97032e5df7"",""53e9a37ab7602d9702c8a9e1"",""53e9ac9bb7602d970367932d"",""53e9abf7b7602d97035ba88a"",""53e9b31bb7602d9703de3ace"",""53e9a07ab7602d97029613d5"",""53e99e8cb7602d9702751585"",""53e9bc0ab7602d970486fb91"",""53e99e71b7602d9702732a38"",""53e9b2e6b7602d9703d9ec25"",""53e9bbf0b7602d970484aac4"",""53e9b206b7602d9703c9ad39"",""53e9b61bb7602d970417079e"",""53e9b89bb7602d9704472edd"",""53e9b234b7602d9703ccf9af"",""53e9a766b7602d970309edc6"",""53e9a797b7602d97030cf7b5"",""53e9b648b7602d97041a474b"",""53e9aa8eb7602d970340973d"",""53e9a487b7602d9702da6a8e""]",Quantized Control Design for Coupled Dynamic Networks with Communication Constraints.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12559-013-9203-6"",""http://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s12559-013-9203-6"",""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-013-9203-6"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""53a7312920f7420be8d283e2"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Cognitive Computation"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",5,2013

Next, Prony models of ambient signals are presented, and the mode shape information of multiple dominant interarea oscillation modes are simultaneously estimated. The advantages of the new ARMA-P method are demonstrated by its applications in both a simulation system and measured data from China Southern Power Grid. © 2013 Wu et al.; licensee Springer.","[{""_id"":""542d638cdabfae11fc4676af"",""bio"":null,""email"":""wuchao@szu.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Chao Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""College of Mechatronics and Control Engineering,Shenzhen University,Shenzhen,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3491c455f439fe41cf6"",""orgs"":[""Shenzhen Univ, Coll Mechatron & Control Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542b9f6adabfae2b4e18ae83"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Chao Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Electrical Engineering,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c860"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542dfffedabfaed7226829eb"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yingduo Han"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Electrical Engineering,Tsinghua University,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c860"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1186/1687-6180-2013-8,"[""Signal processing"",""Autoregressive model"",""Bayesian information criterion"",""Oscillation"",""Computer science"",""Phasor"",""Mode (statistics"",""Algorithm"",""Damping ratio"",""Modal analysis""]",,16876180,1,"[""ELECTROMECHANICAL OSCILLATIONS"",""IDENTIFICATION""]",en,4,null,null,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/337/1298/1756/53e99a04b7602d9702254c40_0.pdf,"[""53e9a94cb7602d970329f26e"",""53e99838b7602d970206253b"",""53e9af26b7602d9703962a07""]",New algorithm for mode shape estimation based on ambient signals considering model order selection.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1687-6180-2013-8"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1186/1687-6180-2013-8"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""58d87c229ed5db79c99c0f01"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""EURASIP J.

53e99a1ab7602d970226f087,"The problem of embedding arises in many machine learning applications with the assumption that there may exist a small number of variabilities which can guarantee the ""semantics"" of the original high-dimensional data. Most of the existing embedding algorithms perform to maintain the locality-preserving property. In this study, inspired by the remarkable success of representation learning and deep learning, we propose a framework of embedding with autoencoder regularization (EAER for short, which incorporates embedding and autoencoding techniques naturally. In this framework, the original data are embedded into the lower dimension, represented by the output of the hidden layer of the autoencoder, thus the resulting data can not only maintain the locality-preserving property but also easily revert to their original forms. This is guaranteed by the joint minimization of the embedding loss and the autoencoder reconstruction error. It is worth mentioning that instead of operating in a batch mode as most of the previous embedding algorithms conduct, the proposed framework actually generates an inductive embedding model and thus supports incremental embedding efficiently. To show the effectiveness of EAER, we adapt this joint learning framework to three canonical embedding algorithms, and apply them to both synthetic and real-world data sets. The experimental results show that the adaption of EAER outperforms its original counterpart. Besides, compared with the existing incremental embedding algorithms, the results demonstrate that EAER performs incremental embedding with more competitive efficiency and effectiveness. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","[{""_id"":""53f43346dabfaeb22f451d9e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wenchao Yu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43a64dabfaee0d9b8a2bc"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guangxiang Zeng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5606fd9c45cedb33969bf969"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ping Luo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""56cb18b1c35f4f3c6565c31f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Fuzhen Zhuang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4ab86dabfaecc1b77b511"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qing He"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f479d7dabfae8a6845c41f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhongzhi Shi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-40994-3_14,"[""Clustering high-dimensional data"",""Embedding"",""Dimensionality reduction"",""Autoencoder"",""Theoretical computer science"",""Minification"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Deep learning"",""Semidefinite embedding"",""Feature learning"",""Mathematics""]",,16113349,3,"[""autoencoder"",""embedding"",""representation learning"",""unsupervised dimensionality reduction""]",en,30,223,208,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/466/360/1839/53e99a1ab7602d970226f087_0.pdf,"[""53e9ba0bb7602d9704611590"",""53e9ade9b7602d97037f502c"",""53e9b221b7602d9703cb7c7e"",""558aaf15e4b031bae1f91134"",""53e9a9dfb7602d97033447f5"",""53e99e04b7602d97026c5a22"",""558c06e3e4b0cfb70a1b341d"",""53e9983db7602d970206714e"",""53e99837b7602d970205cd38"",""53e9af53b7602d970399482f"",""53e9bc88b7602d970490a2d3"",""53e9abc4b7602d9703572998"",""53e9bd3fb7602d97049cf87a"",""53e9a6bcb7602d9702ff1a49"",""53e99d74b7602d970262f2b3"",""53e99875b7602d97020ac6ca"",""53e9b2fab7602d9703dbda78"",""53e99dabb7602d970266b3ae""]",Embedding with Autoencoder Regularization.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40994-3_14""]","{""_id"":""53a72a7520f7420be8c01b5e"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""European conference on Machine Learning"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ECML/PKDD (3"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",8190,2013

53e99a1ab7602d9702271e9f,"This paper studies the bidding selection and assignment problem with a novel constraint, namely minimum quantity commitment (MQC, motivated by the Royal Philips Electronics Company. Responding to the stipulations by the US Federal Maritime Commission, any shipping agent transporting to the US must satisfy a minimum quantity of containers. To insure this MQC for shipping agents, the Royal Philips Electronics Company, with a large number of shipping needs, has to assign enough containers to each selected shipping agent to transport cargos to the US. This restriction creates difficulties for Philips as the company seeks to satisfy its shipping needs with minimum total costs. To solve this problem, we first formulate it by a mixed-integer programming model. In order for both linear programming relaxation and Lagrangian relaxation to provide good lower bounds, we then strengthen the model by a few valid inequalities. Furthermore, a Lagrangian-based heuristic and a branch and cut solver are applied to solve the problem. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of all the models and methods.","[{""_id"":""5408d71adabfae8faa65e0ec"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""A Lim"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":""xuzhou@ust.hk"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Z Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Logist Management, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54483498dabfae87b7de6864"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""F Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602380,"[""Heuristic"",""Mathematical optimization"",""Branch and cut"",""Operations research"",""Integer programming"",""Assignment problem"",""Linear programming"",""Lagrangian relaxation"",""Linear programming relaxation"",""Bidding"",""Mathematics""]",,14769360,5,"[""lagrangian relaxation"",""linear programming"",""minimum quantity commitment"",""selection and assignment"",""linear programming relaxation"",""location"",""branch and cut"",""computer science"",""information technology"",""linear program"",""inventory"",""investment"",""reliability"",""operations research"",""information systems"",""operational research"",""forecasting"",""management science"",""assignment problem"",""satisfiability"",""scheduling"",""production"",""project management"",""communications technology"",""logistics"",""marketing"",""lower bound""]",en,9,702,693,null,"[""53e99dabb7602d970266a267"",""58d82fb8d649053542fd2942"",""53e9b53cb7602d970407296f"",""53e9a3c1b7602d9702cd4198"",""53e999bbb7602d9702200f9f"",""53e99c60b7602d970250fa95"",""53e9aafab7602d970347f0b3"",""53e997f8b7602d97020005af"",""53e9a906b7602d970325a09b""]",The bidding selection and assignment problem with minimum quantity commitment,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602380"",""https://doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602380"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602380"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""53a7325120f7420be8d8e31c"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""JORS"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":11}",59,2008

53e99a0ab7602d970225b59d,"According to the research results reported in the past decades, it is well acknowledged that face recognition is not a trivial
 task. With the development of electronic devices, we are gradually revealing the secret of object recognition in the primate’s
 visual cortex. Therefore, it is time to reconsider face recognition by using biologically inspired features. In this paper,
 we represent face images by utilizing the C1 units, which correspond to complex cells in the visual cortex, and pool over
 S1 units by using a maximum operation to reserve only the maximum response of each local area of S1 units. The new representation
 is termed C1 Face. Because C1 Face is naturally a third-order tensor (or a three dimensional array, we propose three-way
 discriminative locality alignment (TWDLA, an extension of the discriminative locality alignment, which is a top-level discriminate
 manifold learning-based subspace learning algorithm. TWDLA has the following advantages: (1 it takes third-order tensors
 as input directly so the structure information can be well preserved; (2 it models the local geometry over every modality
 of the input tensors so the spatial relations of input tensors within a class can be preserved; (3 it maximizes the margin
 between a tensor and tensors from other classes over each modality so it performs well for recognition tasks and (4 it has

 made for the problem puzzled Delaunay refinement where curved constraints cannot be accepted as input directly. The algorithm
 is based on a new sufficient condition for the existence of constraints in triangulation. It requires computing only the intersection
 between constraints and Voronoi edges or faces instead of the circum-sphere of curved constraint. For the termination of the
 algorithm when small input angles exist in constraints, a weighted method is applied to ensure that the algorithm can terminate
 under any input. Some two-dimensional and three-dimensional results are also presented. It is shown that the algorithm has
 the capability of dealing with both linear and nonlinear constraints in a consistent way, without the need of maintaining
 triangular meshes on face constraints.","[{""_id"":""53f433a8dabfaeb1a7bd900c"",""bio"":null,""email"":""xhmeng@buaa.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b8692c0e1cd8e14a35af763"",""name"":""XianHai Meng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""BeiHang University NLSDE, School of Computer Science and Engineering Beijing 100083 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b41c455f439fe3da46"",""orgs"":[""BeiHang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, NLSDE, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542ab553dabfae646d58154f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b8692c0e1cd8e14a35af763"",""name"":""JiGang Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""BeiHang University NLSDE, School of Computer Science and Engineering Beijing 100083 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b41c455f439fe3da46"",""orgs"":[""BeiHang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, NLSDE, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a8191dabfae646d56b572"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b8692c0e1cd8e14a35af763"",""name"":""Qin Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""BeiHang University NLSDE, School of Computer Science and Engineering Beijing 100083 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b41c455f439fe3da46"",""orgs"":[""BeiHang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, NLSDE, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a1a73dabfae8785da1319"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86bf21e1cd8e14a3893f99"",""name"":""Qiang Cai"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Beijing Technology and Business University School of Computer Sciences Beijing 100037 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e3a3"",""orgs"":[""Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46d72dabfaee2a1dcaf53"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86ca84e1cd8e14a3daf561"",""name"":""QiMing Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""BeiHang University School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation Beijing 100083 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b41c455f439fe3da46"",""orgs"":[""BeiHang Univ, Sch Mech Engn & Automat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-010-0097-6,"[""Topology"",""Chew's second algorithm"",""Minimum-weight triangulation"",""Bowyer–Watson algorithm"",""Surface triangulation"",""Constrained Delaunay triangulation"",""Mathematics"",""Pitteway triangulation"",""Delaunay triangulation"",""Ruppert's algorithm""]",,18622836,6,"[""delaunay triangulation"",""weight"",""mesh generation"",""tetrahedralization"",""conforming"",""curved constraints"",""three dimensional"",""triangular mesh""]",en,4,1140,1130,null,"[""53e9ab82b7602d970352b268"",""53e9a734b7602d970306a2a3"",""53e9abb2b7602d9703562710"",""53e99809b7602d9702020df8"",""599c7ba8601a182cd27544f4"",""53e9ac38b7602d97035fefbe"",""53e9ad1fb7602d9703701f66"",""53e9b822b7602d97043dacad"",""53e9acf0b7602d97036d159f"",""53e9b866b7602d9704430ad9"",""53e9ad98b7602d9703793626"",""53e9a130b7602d9702a1dcc0"",""53e9984fb7602d9702086765"",""53e9afa0b7602d97039ecc50""]",Complex conforming Delaunay triangulation,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-010-0097-6"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-010-0097-6"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b77cea80f95414b7de"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",53,2010

 This paper presents an approach to build a novel two-level collocation net, which enables calculation of the collocation relationship
 between any two words, from a large raw corpus. The first level consists of atomic classes (each atomic class consists of
 one word and feature bigram, which are clustered into the second level class set. Each class in both levels is represented
 by its collocation candidate distribution, extracted from the linguistic analysis of the raw training corpus, over possible
 collocation relation types. In this way, all the information extracted from the linguistic analysis is kept in the collocation
 net. Our approach applies to both frequently and less-frequently occurring words by providing a clustering mechanism resolve
 the data sparseness problem through the collocation net. Experimentation shows that the collocation net is efficient and effective
 in solving the data sparseness problem and determining the collocation relationship between any two words.

Adaptable design aims at identifying the designs and products considering functionality, manufacturing efforts, customization, and environment friendliness. This research focuses on adaptable design considering product adaptability. In this work, product adaptability is evaluated by three measures including extendibility of functions, upgradeability of modules, and customizability of components. Various design candidates created in adaptable design are evaluated by different life-cycle evaluation measures including product adaptability of design, part and assembly costs of manufacturing, and operationability of customers. Since different evaluation measures are modeled in different units, the grey relational analysis method is employed to integrate these measures for prioritizing different design candidates. A case study is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced adaptable design approach.","[{""_id"":""54450e5fdabfae862da02cec"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""y b li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""university of calgary"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8dc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43a4bdabfaee43ec54a5b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Deyi Xue"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""university of calgary"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8dc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f47d1edabfaee43ed4c1ed"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Peihua Gu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""university of calgary"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2891c455f439fe3c8dc"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1177/1063293X08096178,"[""Adaptability"",""Design paradigm"",""Systems engineering"",""Grey relational analysis"",""Engineering"",""Design evaluation"",""Personalization""]",,15312003,3,"[""design evaluation"",""product adaptability"",""grey relational analysis method."",""adaptable design"",""design""]",en,83,232,221,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1740/954/894/53e99a2fb7602d9702288b49_0.pdf,"[""53e9b634b7602d97041905c8"",""53e9a894b7602d97031e014f"",""53e9b116b7602d9703b98837"",""53e9a327b7602d9702c329bd"",""53e9b42fb7602d9703f279d9"",""53e9b8aeb7602d97044862a1"",""53e9b123b7602d9703ba0baa"",""53e9bbadb7602d97047f87c0""]",Design for Product Adaptability,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1063293X08096178"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/DETC2007-35179""]","{""_id"":""555036bd7cea80f95414f329"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Concurrent Engineering: R&A"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",16,2008

In this paper, we address photometric issues on chrominance variation and luminance nonuniformity in multi-display system constructed using LCD projectors. A three-phase approach is proposed to construct imaging models, which makes transformations among them when formulating the whole imaging procedure. These models are named as single-projector model, normalized-projector model and display-wall model. Single-projector model describes the imaging procedure from the projector's input color to its measured tristimulus values in CIEXYZ. Normalized-projector model denotes the common gamut of projectors, which normalizes each single-projector model, and makes every projector have the same ranges of chrominance and luminance. The display-wall model treats the whole display as one projector, which has similar photometric model to single LCD projector. Weighting light contributions from all projectors using the display wall model, our method can achieve visually plausible seamlessness.","[{""_id"":""53f49870dabfaee0d9c74c6b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b1b0e1cd8e14a327f6a5"",""name"":""Lei Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Computer Graphics Laboratory, Software School, Fudan University, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c861"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42dbfdabfaedf4351b926"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b1b0e1cd8e14a327f6a5"",""name"":""Siyu Liang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Computer Graphics Laboratory, Software School, Fudan University, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c861"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a9072dabfae61d49906ae"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b1b0e1cd8e14a327f6a5"",""name"":""Bo Qin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Computer Graphics Laboratory, Software School, Fudan University, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c861"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43161dabfaec22ba4b320"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b1b0e1cd8e14a327f6a5"",""name"":""Zhongding Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Computer Graphics Laboratory, Software School, Fudan University, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c861"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-12304-7_6,"[""Computer vision"",""Gamut"",""Weighting"",""Computer graphics (images"",""Computer science"",""Chrominance"",""Photometry (optics"",""Projector"",""Liquid-crystal display"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Luminance"",""LCD projector""]",3-642-12303-1,16113349,2,"[""multi-projector display"",""single-projector model"",""lcd projector"",""imaging procedure"",""imaging model"",""normalized-projector model"",""display wall model"",""three-phase approach"",""display-wall model"",""single lcd projector"",""similar photometric model""]",en,3,65,56,null,"[""53e99875b7602d97020ac54e"",""53e9aeb7b7602d97038d9c63"",""53e9bb86b7602d97047cf9b5"",""53e9baf2b7602d9704725fb4"",""558a410b84ae84d265bc820a"",""53e9ac12b7602d97035d1915"",""53e99d21b7602d97025d5237"",""53e9b655b7602d97041b0d53"",""53e9a09fb7602d970298a4b8"",""53e9bb86b7602d97047cdc3a"",""53e9b4c9b7602d9703fe3758""]",A three-phase approach to photometric calibration for multi-projector display using LCD projectors,"[""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78650446248""]","{""_id"":""54824c66582fc50b5e008eb0"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Asian Conference on Computer Vision"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",5995,2010

 development. In this paper, we present an approach for transforming UML system requirement models with OCL specifications

 UML can be described as a sequence of system operations. A system operation can be formally defined by a pair of preconditions
 and postconditions specified using OCL in the context of the conceptual class model. By analyzing the semantics of the preconditions
 and postconditions, the execution of the operation can be prototyped as a sequence of primitive actions which first check
 the precondition, and then enforce the postcondition by transferring the system from a pre-state to a post-state step by step.
 The primitive actions are basic manipulations of the system state (an object diagram, including find objects and links, create and remove objects and links, and check and set attribute values.

The criterion to be optimised is the long-run expected average cost, and several kinds of constraints are imposed on some associated costs. The existence of a constrained optimal policy is ensured under suitable conditions by using a martingale technique and introducing an occupation measure. Furthermore, for the unichain model, we transform this multiconstrained problem into an equivalent linear programming problem, then construct a constrained optimal policy from an optimal solution to the linear programming. Finally, we use an example of a controlled queueing system to illustrate an application of our results. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","[{""_id"":""53f4339adabfaec09f161580"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiuli Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42b55dabfaeb2acfc96d5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hangsheng Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a7594dabfae646d564eab"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xianping Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1080/00207721.2010.517868,"[""Mathematical optimization"",""Martingale (probability theory"",""Countable set"",""Partially observable Markov decision process"",""Markov decision process"",""Average cost"",""Linear programming"",""Queueing system"",""State space"",""Mathematics""]",,14645319,3,"[""average cost"",""constrained optimal policy"",""markov decision processes"",""occupation measure"",""linear program"",""state space"",""constrained optimization"",""markov decision process""]",en,1,585,576,null,"[""53e9a9d3b7602d9703334518"",""53e9bdb2b7602d9704a5f235"",""53e9a0dfb7602d97029c754c"",""53e9be3cb7602d9704af7ec6"",""53e9a5afb7602d9702ed6f39"",""53e9a6aeb7602d9702fe255b"",""53e9b666b7602d97041c952e"",""5cc1b60f6558b90bfabfeb24""]",Denumerable continuous-time Markov decision processes with multiconstraints on average costs.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2010.517868""]","{""_id"":""555036f07cea80f954166ec3"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Journal of Systems Science"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Int.

 Given an edge-weighted undirected graph G = (V,E,c,w, where each edge e ∈ E has a cost c(e and a weight w(e, a set S ⊆ V of terminals and a positive constant D
 0, we seek a minimum cost Steiner tree where all terminals appear as leaves and its diameter is bounded by D
 0. Note that the diameter of a tree represents the maximum weight of path connecting two different leaves in the tree. Such
 problem is called the minimum cost diameter-constrained Steiner tree problem. This problem is NP-hard even when the topology
 of Steiner tree is fixed. In present paper we focus on this restricted version and present a fully polynomial time approximation
 scheme (FPTAS for computing a minimum cost diameter-constrained Steiner tree under a fixed topology.

53e99a20b7602d970227437c,"Maximum margin clustering (MMC is a newly proposed clustering method that extends the large-margin computation of support vector machine (SVM to unsupervised learning. Traditionally, MMC is formulated as a nonconvex integer programming problem which makes it difficult to solve. Several methods rely on reformulating and relaxing the nonconvex optimization problem as semidefinite programming (SDP or second-order cone program (SOCP, which are computationally expensive and have difficulty handling large-scale data sets. In linear cases, by making use of the constrained concave-convex procedure (CCCP and cutting plane algorithm, several MMC methods take linear time to converge to a local optimum, but in nonlinear cases, time complexity is still high. Since extreme learning machine (ELM has achieved similar generalization performance at much faster learning speed than traditional SVM and LS-SVM, we propose an extreme maximum margin clustering (EMMC algorithm based on ELM. It can perform well in nonlinear cases. Moreover, the kernel parameters of EMMC need not be tuned by means of random feature mappings. Experimental results on several real-world data sets show that EMMC performs better than traditional MMC methods, especially in handling large-scale data sets.

53e99a14b7602d9702265f4b,"Outlier detection has important applications in the field of data mining, such as fraud detection, customer behavior analysis,
 and intrusion detection. Outlier detection is the process of detecting the data objects which are grossly different from or
 inconsistent with the remaining set of data. Outliers are traditionally considered as single points; however, there is a key
 observation that many abnormal events have both temporal and spatial locality, which might form small clusters that also need
 to be deemed as outliers. In other words, not only a single point but also a small cluster can probably be an outlier. In
 this paper, we present a new definition for outliers: cluster-based outlier, which is meaningful and provides importance to

53e99a26b7602d9702280851,"A spectrum sensing scheme for cognitive radio that includes coarse and fine sensing stages based on cyclostationarity is proposed in this paper. The cyclostationary feature detection (CFD based on a single cyclic frequency (SCF is used in the coarse sensing stage and that based on multiple cyclic frequencies (MCF is employed in the fine sensing stage. Whether the fine sensing stage is performed or not is decided by comparing the statistic constructed in the coarse sensing stage with two thresholds. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed sensing scheme has superior sensing performance and needs shorter sensing time.

53e999e0b7602d97022285af,"Low-rank matrix completion is an important theme both theoretically and practically. However, the state-of-the-art methods based on convex optimization usually lead to a certain amount of deviation from the original matrix. To perfectly recover a data matrix from a sampling of its entries, we consider a non-convex alternative to approximate the matrix rank. In particular, we minimize a matrix γ-norm under a set of linear constraints. Accordingly, we derive a shrinkage operator, which is nearly unbiased in comparison with the well-known soft shrinkage operator. Furthermore, we devise two algorithms, non-convex soft imputation (NCSI and non-convex alternative direction method of multipliers (NCADMM, to fulfil the numerical estimation. Experimental results show that these algorithms outperform existing matrix completion methods in accuracy. Moreover, the NCADMM is as efficient as the current state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","[{""_id"":""56026d5a45cedb3395f932cc"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Dehua Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45a47dabfaec09f214203"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Tengfei Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""562ce1ac45cedb3398cf19ed"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hui Qian"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f437fadabfaeee229b9877"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Congfu Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5408bdf7dabfae44f088206c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhihua Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-40991-2_14,"[""Convergent matrix"",""Rank (linear algebra"",""Mathematical optimization"",""Matrix completion"",""Matrix (mathematics"",""Eigenvalue algorithm"",""Eigendecomposition of a matrix"",""Convex optimization"",""Sparse matrix"",""Mathematics""]",,16113349,2,[],en,19,225,210,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/606/1155/1621/53e999e0b7602d97022285af_0.pdf,"[""53e99e7fb7602d97027445a0"",""53e9a09fb7602d97029882ca"",""558c6004e4b0cfb70a1d54a7"",""53e9af0cb7602d9703942ddd"",""53e99c66b7602d97025151fb"",""53e9aa2bb7602d97033979b6"",""53e9b543b7602d970407bd2d"",""53e9ba6ab7602d970468b3d4"",""53e9982cb7602d9702054041"",""53e9bd3fb7602d97049cd2ed"",""53e9ba1cb7602d970462492c"",""5c8a7c054895d9cbc62deff0"",""5ff68b29d4150a363cce8467"",""53e9b495b7602d9703f9a6d1"",""53e99bf0b7602d970249b1cb"",""53e9a718b7602d970304e382"",""53e99df7b7602d97026bb172"",""53e9ba60b7602d9704678242"",""53e9b542b7602d970407a1a3""]",A Nearly Unbiased Matrix Completion Approach.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40991-2_14""]","{""_id"":""555037947cea80f954190a20"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""European conference on Machine Learning"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ECML/PKDD"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",8189,2013

 Wu and Yuan (Bull. Math. Biol. 71:1914–1933, 2009 for the solution of the distance geometry problem with sparse and inexact distances. This algorithm repeatedly uses a least-squares
 approximation to determine the position of an undetermined atom, using the distances from this atom to a set of previously
 determined ones. The least-squares approximation, obtained from the singular value decomposition of a distance-induced matrix,
 can find the best possible position for the atom, even if the distances have small errors, as they usually do in practice,
 and therefore make the geometric buildup algorithm more stable than its previous versions that relied on linear system solvers.
 We estimate its numerical errors and prove some of its key mathematical properties. We also present some numerical results
 with varying some of the parameters in the algorithm and show how they may be used to improve its performance and computational

53e99a98b7602d970230e5d5,"This paper presents an inertial estimator learning automata scheme by which both the short-term and long-term perspectives of the environment can be incorporated in the stochastic estimator-the long term information crystallized in terms of the running reward-probability estimates, and the short term information used by considering whether the most recent response was a reward or a penalty. Thus, when the shortterm perspective is considered, the stochastic estimator becomes pertinent in the context of the estimator algorithms. The proposed automata employ an inertial weight estimator as the short-term perspective to achieve a rapid and accurate convergence when operating in stationary random environments. According to the proposed inertial estimator scheme, the estimates of the reward probabilities of actions are affected by the last response from environment. In this way, actions that have gotten the positive response from environment in the short time, have the opportunity to be estimated as ""optimal"", to increase their choice probability and consequently, to be selected. The estimates become more reliable and consequently, the automaton rapidly and accurately converges to the optimal action. The asymptotic behavior of the proposed scheme is analyzed and it is proved to be ε-optimal in every stationary random environment. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm converges faster than the traditional stochastic-estimator-based SERI scheme, and the deterministicestimator- based DGPA and DPRI schemes when operating in stationary random environments.

We address the problem of sequence classification using rules composed of interesting itemsets found in a dataset of labelled sequences and accompanying class labels. We measure the interestingness of an itemset in a given class of sequences by combining the cohesion and the support of the itemset. We use the discovered itemsets to generate confident classification rules, and present two different ways of building a classifier. The first classifier is based on the CBA (Classification based on associations method, but we use a new ranking strategy for the generated rules, achieving better results. The second classifier ranks the rules by first measuring their value specific to the new data object. Experimental results show that our classifiers outperform existing comparable classifiers in terms of accuracy and stability, while maintaining a computational advantage over sequential pattern based classification.","[{""_id"":""53f43bb6dabfaeecd6991a09"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Cheng Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f47007dabfaec09f26522b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Boris Cule"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4cdf7dabfaee0d9c77860"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Bart Goethals"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-40988-2_23,"[""Cohesion (chemistry"",""Pattern recognition"",""Ranking"",""Association rule learning"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Data objects"",""Classifier (linguistics"",""Linear classifier"",""Machine learning"",""Mathematics""]",,16113349,1,[],en,14,368,353,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/531/1900/264/53e99a98b7602d9702312b61_0.pdf,"[""53e9a4c0b7602d9702de2268"",""558aa74ce4b0b32fcb3811eb"",""53e9acb5b7602d970369122b"",""53e9a61fb7602d9702f4def1"",""53e9aefcb7602d9703930008"",""53e9a4b8b7602d9702dd9d62"",""53e9a408b7602d9702d24245"",""53e99845b7602d970207221c"",""53e9abf7b7602d97035b7c48"",""53e9b102b7602d9703b803ea"",""53e9b137b7602d9703bbac9b"",""53e9b9e1b7602d97045daa60"",""53e99be3b7602d970248e6dc"",""53e999cab7602d970220d0a8"",""53e9a914b7602d9703264a8d"",""53e9a720b7602d9703055c33"",""53e99de1b7602d97026a1b34""]",Itemset Based Sequence Classification,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40988-2_23"",""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2722829.2722856&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=521678149&CFTOKEN=12511818&preflayout=flat""]","{""_id"":""53a72a7520f7420be8c01b60"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""European conference on Machine Learning"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ECML/PKDD (1"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",8188,2013
53e99a57b7602d97022c29aa,"Complex networks are everywhere. A typical example is software network. Basing on analyzing evolutive structure of the software
 networks, we consider accelerating growth of network as power-law growth, which can be more easily generalized to real systems
 than linear growth. For accelerating growth via a power law and scale-free state with preferential linking, we focus on exploring
 the generic property of complex networks. Generally, two scenarios are possible. In one of them, the links are undirected.
 In the other scenario, the links are directed. We propose two models that can predict the emergence of power-law growth and
 scale-free state in good agreement with these two scenarios and can simulate much more real systems than existing scale-free
 network models. Moreover, we use the obtained predictions to fit accelerating growth and the connectivity distribution of
 software networks describing scale-free structure. The combined analytical and numerical results indicate the emergence of
 a novel set of models that considerably enhance our ability to understand and characterize complex networks, whose applicability
 reaches far beyond the quoted examples.","[{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":""lihuan2501@163.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Huan Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shanghai University of Political Science and Law Center of Modern Educational Technology Shanghai 201701 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b8c51c455f439fe60bb3"",""orgs"":[""Shanghai Univ Polit Sci & Law, Ctr Modern Educ Technol, Shanghai 201701, Peoples R China"",""Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Software Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11704-009-0041-3,"[""Dynamic network analysis"",""Network formation"",""Computer science"",""Network simulation"",""Generic property"",""Scale-free network"",""Software"",""Complex network"",""Network model"",""Distributed computing""]",,16737466,3,"[""complex network"",""software network"",""scale-free network"",""accelerating growth""]",en,4,380,373,null,"[""55a584df612c6b12ab1fe50e"",""53e9a618b7602d9702f46b59"",""53e9aa95b7602d970340e7a3"",""53e9be15b7602d9704ad03cb"",""53e9a44eb7602d9702d67b55"",""53e9b070b7602d9703ad84cd"",""53e9b4d4b7602d9703ff7208"",""53e9bc5ab7602d97048d0c46"",""53e9a37ab7602d9702c86cb7""]",Scale-free network models with accelerating growth,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-009-0041-3"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11704-009-0041-3"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""5390ac8520f70186a0eb758b"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Frontiers of Computer Science in China"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",3,2009

We consider a real-time scenario where the data aggregation must be performed within a specified latency constraint. The objective is to minimize the overall energy cost of the sensor nodes in the aggregation tree subject to the latency constraint. We propose an algorithm that can construct a data aggregation tree with theoretically bounded energy cost under the latency constraint. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm is very efficient in energy-saving under the latency constraint and has better performance than other existing algorithms. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

53e99a9fb7602d9702318bf0,"The paper compares the efficiency of single and double attack against a system consisting of identical parallel elements. An attacker maximizes the system vulnerability (probability of total destruction. In order to destroy the system, the attacker distributes its constrained resource optimally across two attacks and chooses the number of elements to be attacked in the first attack. The attacker observes which elements are destroyed and not destroyed in the first attack and allocates its remaining resource into attacking the remaining elements in the second attack. The paper considers two types of identification errors: wrong identification of a destroyed element as not destroyed, and wrong identification of a not destroyed element as destroyed. First, the influence of the identification error probabilities on the optimal attack strategy against a system with a fixed number of elements is analysed. Thereafter, a minmax two-period game between the attacker and the defender is considered, in which the defender in the first period distributes its constrained resource between deploying redundant elements and protecting them against the attack in the second period. It is shown how the identification error probabilities affect the defence strategy. © 2012 Operational Research Society Ltd.

 human body, especially for the medical applications. Based on the integrated superframe structure of IEEE 802.15.4, a modified
 medium access control (MAC protocol, named Hybrid Unified-slot Access (HUA protocol for WBANs is proposed with focus on
 the simplicity, dependability and power efficiency. Considering the support to multiple physical layer (PHY technologies
 including ultra-wide band (UWB, the slotted ALOHA is employed in the contention access period (CAP to request the slot allocation.
 Mini-slot method is designed to enhance the efficiency of the contention. Moreover, sufficient slot allocation in the contention-free
 period (CFP makes HUA adaptive to the different traffic including the medical and non-medical applications. Simulation results
 show that the protocol effectively decreases the probability of collision in a CAP and extends the CFP slots to support more
 traffic with quality of service (QoS guarantee.","[{""_id"":""53f4c8a3dabfaee57a77de12"",""bio"":null,""email"":""clli@mail.xidian.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b869907e1cd8e14a38405b7"",""name"":""Changle LiJiandong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, No. 2 Tai Bai South Road, P.O.

53e99a92b7602d970230aa4b,"Motivation: Motif identification for sequences has many important applications in biological studies, e.g., diagnostic probe design, locating binding sites and regulatory signals, and potential drug target identification. There are two versions. 1. Single Group: Given a group of n sequences, find a length-l motif that appears in each of the given sequences and those occurrences of the motif are similar. 2. Two Groups: Given two groups of sequences B and G, find a length-l (distinguishing motif that appears in every sequence in B and does not appear in anywhere of the sequences in G. Here the occurrences of the motif in the given sequences have errors. Currently, most of existing programs can only handle the case of single group. Moreover, it is very difficult to use edit distance (allowing indels and replacements for motif detection. In this paper, (1 We propose a randomized algorithm for the one group problem that can handle indels in the occurrences of the motif. (2 We give an algorithm for the two groups problem.

53e99a73b7602d97022e1395,"Nowadays, it is popular that the dealer makes profits by selling a kind of discount coupons, which can be used as money to purchase commodities with total cost less than or equal to the face value of the coupon. We can purchase a coupon at a price of 0 < s ≤ 1 times its face value and the number of potential purchasable coupons is a given integer l. The customer has the option to buy the goods by cash completely or by a discount coupon. However, each piece of goods can only use one coupon and the coupon used must have enough balance for the goods. The objective is to minimize the total cost for purchasing all the goods. In this paper, we reduce the problem to a special bin packing model. We consider the online problems for all 0 < s ≤ 1 and 1 ≤ l ≤ ∞. We present optimal online algorithms for all 0 < s ≤ 1 when l = ∞ and l = 1.

53e99a9eb7602d9702314835,"Spectral graph partitioning is a powerful tool for unsupervised data learning. Most existing algorithms for spectral graph partitioning directly utilize the pairwise similarity matrix of the data to perform graph partitioning. Consequently, they are incapable of fully capturing the intrinsic structural information of graphs. To address this problem, we propose a novel random walk diffusion similarity measure (RWDSM for capturing the intrinsic structural information of graphs. The RWDSM is composed of three key components—emission, absorbing, and transmission. It is proven that graph partitioning on the RWDSM matrix performs better than on the pairwise similarity matrix of the data. Moreover, a spectral graph partitioning objective function (referred to as DGPC is used for capturing the discriminant information of graphs. The DGPC is designed to effectively characterize the intra-class compactness and the inter-class separability. Based on the RWDSM and DGPC, we further develop a novel spectral graph partitioning algorithm (referred to as DGPCA. Theoretic analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of the developed DGPCA.","[{""_id"":""53f7fecedabfae92b40fd9d0"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869e2ee1cd8e14a3a7dff8"",""name"":""Xi Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, CASIA, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4a440dabfaec65977b3ba"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869e2ee1cd8e14a3a7dff8"",""name"":""Weiming Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, CASIA, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f48c13dabfaea7cd1ce072"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86ca6ce1cd8e14a3da3ff7"",""name"":""Zhongfei Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""State University of New York, Binghamton, NY"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2961c455f439fe3ce79"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f64db9dabfae0633f156b1"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869e2ee1cd8e14a3a7dff8"",""name"":""Yang Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, CASIA, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-12304-7_63,"[""Discrete mathematics"",""Random graph"",""Similarity measure"",""Random walk"",""Discriminant"",""Matrix (mathematics"",""Algorithm"",""Compact space"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Conductance"",""Graph partition"",""Mathematics""]",3-642-12303-1,16113349,2,"[""unsupervised data"",""intrinsic structural information"",""discriminant information"",""spectral graph"",""random walk diffusion similarity"",""graph partitioning"",""spectral graph partitioning"",""similarity measure"",""rwdsm matrix"",""novel spectral graph"",""pairwise similarity matrix"",""random walk"",""objective function""]",en,2,676,667,null,"[""53e9ba4ab7602d970466004d"",""53e99ad0b7602d9702352122"",""53e9b895b7602d970446bba7"",""53e99842b7602d97020713f3"",""53e9b8bab7602d9704497848"",""53e9a789b7602d97030c7617"",""558a3600e4b037c08755cbde"",""53e9a396b7602d9702ca3448"",""53e9af87b7602d97039d0ed9"",""557f4486f6678c77ea22937c"",""558a94fae4b0b32fcb37a92f"",""53e9ad47b7602d970372e329"",""53e9a7eab7602d9703127715"",""53e9afe8b7602d9703a3af5a"",""53e99a78b7602d97022e8727"",""53e9a3bab7602d9702ccbbf6""]",Spectral graph partitioning based on a random walk diffusion similarity measure,"[""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/78650489293""]","{""_id"":""54824c66582fc50b5e008eb0"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Asian Conference on Computer Vision"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",5995,2010
53e99a74b7602d97022e3e23,"Face verification is the task of determining whether two given face images represent the same person or not. It is a very challenging task, as the face images, captured in the uncontrolled environments, may have large variations in illumination, expression, pose, background, etc. The crucial problem is how to compute the similarity of two face images. Metric learning has provided a viable solution to this problem. Until now, many metric learning algorithms have been proposed, but they are usually limited to learning a linear transformation. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear metric learning method, which leams an explicit mapping from the original space to an optimal subspace using deep Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA network. Compared to the linear or kernel based metric learning methods, the proposed deep ISA network is a deep and local learning architecture, and therefore exhibits more powerful ability to learn the nature of highly variable dataset. We evaluate our method on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset, and results show superior performance over some state-of-the-art methods.© 2013 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.","[{""_id"":""53f42e53dabfaee1c0a3fdc9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xinyuan Cai"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42e00dabfaec22ba1fd11"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Chunheng Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43a91dabfaee43ec57b68"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Baihua Xiao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4898fdabfaec09f2af978"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yunxue Shao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1587/transinf.E96.D.2830,"[""Kernel (linear algebra"",""Face verification"",""Nonlinear system"",""Semi-supervised learning"",""Subspace topology"",""Local learning"",""Pattern recognition"",""Computer science"",""Learning methods"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Linear map"",""Machine learning""]",,17451361,12,"[""deep learning architecture"",""face verification"",""independent subspace analysis"",""metric learning""]",en,0,2838,2830,null,"[""53e9bcdab7602d9704962cda"",""53e99833b7602d9702059d32"",""53e99a85b7602d97022f9b26"",""558c267e84ae6766fdf1566a"",""53e9ab4fb7602d97034e0425"",""53e9b2dbb7602d9703d91fd6"",""558c22e0e4b00c3c48e073b5"",""53e9b0e6b7602d9703b620cd"",""53e99af7b7602d970238423b"",""53e9bb7fb7602d97047c29ce"",""53e9b783b7602d9704328658"",""53e99924b7602d970215faff"",""53e9b326b7602d9703df7573"",""53e998b8b7602d97020f3e01"",""53e9a48eb7602d9702daa703"",""53e9b9e7b7602d97045e0b50"",""53e99ccab7602d970257ee91"",""53e9a237b7602d9702b3be52"",""53e9b04eb7602d9703ab5705"",""53e99d9eb7602d970265acee"",""53e9b46ab7602d9703f6d1d0"",""558c015ee4b02b9f07a48751"",""53e9b991b7602d9704580809"",""53e9a13fb7602d9702a2cca9"",""53e99efbb7602d97027c9734"",""53e99a8cb7602d9702301963"",""53e99ef4b7602d97027c3672""]",Nonlinear Metric Learning with Deep Independent Subspace Analysis Network for Face Verification.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1587/transinf.E96.D.2830"",""http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e96-d_12_2830""]","{""_id"":""555036cc7cea80f95415814b"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IEICE Transactions"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",96,2013
53e99a62b7602d97022ce6ee,"A variety of logical frameworks have been developed to study rational agents interacting over time. This paper takes a closer
 look at one particular interface, between two systems that both address the dynamics of knowledge and information flow. The
 first is Epistemic Temporal Logic (ETL which uses linear or branching time models with added epistemic structure induced
 by agents’ different capabilities for observing events. The second framework is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL that describes
 interactive processes in terms of epistemic event models which may occur inside modalities of the language. This paper systematically
 and rigorously relates the DEL framework with the ETL framework. The precise relationship between DEL and ETL is explored
 via a new representation theorem characterizing the largest class of ETL models corresponding to DEL protocols in terms of notions of Perfect Recall, No Miracles, and Bisimulation Invariance. We then focus on new issues of completeness. One contribution is an axiomatization for the dynamic logic of public announcements constrained by protocols, which has
 been an open problem for some years, as it does not fit the usual ‘reduction axiom’ format of DEL. Finally, we provide a number
 of examples that show how DEL suggests an interesting fine-structure inside ETL.","[{""_id"":""53f431e8dabfaec22ba51e9c"",""bio"":null,""email"":""johan@science.uva.nl"",""gid"":""5b86a3d7e1cd8e14a3cd2272"",""name"":""Johan van Benthem"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""University of Amsterdam Institute for Logic, Language and Computation Amsterdam The Netherlands"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2e21c455f439fe3ef32"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f44a37dabfaefedbb233dd"",""bio"":null,""email"":""jelle@gerbrandy.com"",""gid"":""5b86a9bae1cd8e14a3f2f4e1"",""name"":""Jelle Gerbrandy"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""University of Torino Departimento di Informatica Turin Italy"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2a81c455f439fe3d514"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4c734dabfaee57f77d004"",""bio"":null,""email"":""thoshi@stanford.edu"",""gid"":""5b86c926e1cd8e14a3d0fc26"",""name"":""Tomohiro Hoshi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Stanford University Department of Philosophy Stanford CA USA"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f7ba8bdabfae8faa4ad5b8"",""bio"":null,""email"":""epacuit@stanford.edu"",""gid"":""5b86c926e1cd8e14a3d0fc26"",""name"":""Eric Pacuit"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Stanford University Department of Philosophy Stanford CA USA"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s10992-008-9099-x,"[""Epistemic modal logic"",""Open problem"",""Axiom"",""Computer science"",""Algorithm"",""Multimodal logic"",""Linear temporal logic"",""Theoretical computer science"",""Bisimulation"",""Dynamic logic (digital electronics"",""Completeness (statistics""]",,15730433,5,"[""dynamic epistemic logic"",""epistemic logic"",""epistemic temporal logic"",""information processing"",""logical framework"",""information flow"",""common knowledge"",""dynamic logic"",""fine structure"",""rational agent"",""temporal logic"",""philosophy""]",en,175,526,491,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/266/659/62/53e99a62b7602d97022ce6ee_0.pdf,"[""53e9a6d1b7602d97030082e8"",""53e9bde2b7602d9704a94748"",""53e9b7bab7602d9704361d35"",""53e9aa95b7602d9703411ef2"",""53e9af99b7602d97039e3527"",""53e9b857b7602d970441d171"",""53e9b56cb7602d97040a7836"",""53e99dccb7602d970268d8c4"",""53e99ff5b7602d97028d94c7"",""53e9b233b7602d9703ccc7eb"",""53e9ad18b7602d97036fb335"",""53e9a3b3b7602d9702cc39d6"",""53e99a7fb7602d97022f5935"",""53e99a8cb7602d970230176d"",""53e9a562b7602d9702e8af62"",""53e9bde9b7602d9704a9b73f"",""53e9a1c2b7602d9702ab7945"",""53e9ab97b7602d9703544772""]",Merging Frameworks for Interaction,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10992-008-9099-x"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10992-008-9099-x""]","{""_id"":""555036d97cea80f95415f7fa"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""J.

53e99a79b7602d97022ecce4,"We study the link scheduling for rechargeable wireless ad hoc and sensor networks to improve network throughput. Efficient link scheduling is highly critical for wireless networks, and a lot of efforts have been made to address this issue. The previous work which only considers how to reduce interference within close-by links, however, fails to improve the network throughput for rechargeable wireless network in which a node, powered by ambient energy (such like solar and vibration has to be recharged before it can communicate with other nodes. Thus, link scheduling with rechargeable nodes is constrained not only by co-channel interference but also by energy replenishment of the node. In this paper, we develop efficient link scheduling algorithms to improve the network throughput of rechargeable wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. The proposed design, based on realistic network models and mathematical formulation, achieves constant ratio of the best solution. Besides the theoretical analysis, simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate our algorithms. © 2013 Liao et al.; licensee Springer.","[{""_id"":""53f43c45dabfaee1c0ad2812"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guodong Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Information Science and Technology,Beijing Forestry University,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e36d"",""orgs"":[""Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46f48dabfaee4dc871695"",""bio"":null,""email"":""qgfhit@163.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Guofu Qiao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Civil Engineering,Harbin Institute of Technology,Harbin,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""56028f7a45cedb3395fdb48e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lin Zhao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Information Science and Technology,Beijing Forestry University,Beijing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e36d"",""orgs"":[""Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1186/1687-1499-2013-223,"[""Mobile ad hoc network"",""Wireless network"",""Key distribution in wireless sensor networks"",""Computer science"",""Computer network"",""Optimized Link State Routing Protocol"",""Maximum throughput scheduling"",""Wireless ad hoc network"",""Wireless sensor network"",""Vehicular ad hoc network""]",,16871499,1,"[""Time Slot"","" Traffic Load"","" Network Throughput"","" Communication Graph"","" Schedule Period""]",en,17,null,null,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1346/242/1172/53e99a79b7602d97022ecce4_0.pdf,"[""53e9a508b7602d9702e268e1"",""53e99dc5b7602d9702685260"",""53e99eeeb7602d97027b8c62"",""53e99dc5b7602d9702685261"",""53e9ab6eb7602d970350b79e"",""53e9b0b2b7602d9703b1cc82"",""53e9aa4fb7602d97033bee00"",""53e99a0ab7602d9702256b1e"",""53e99fb4b7602d970288d5d6"",""55831c790cf24856147006fd"",""53e9adaab7602d97037aa716"",""53e9aa32b7602d970339d28c"",""53e99a48b7602d97022a8f94"",""53e99d65b7602d970261fc45"",""53e9ae22b7602d9703836d20"",""5cc84c7b6558b90bfa7cf5e7"",""53e9a4c7b7602d9702de909b"",""53e9b76eb7602d9704312f00"",""53e9b937b7602d970452312a"",""53e9b3e2b7602d9703ecff55"",""558a3317e4b037c08755bae5"",""53e99bbfb7602d9702464be1"",""53e9b2d7b7602d9703d8a60e"",""53e9a102b7602d97029f03b3"",""53e9ae84b7602d97038a4154"",""53e9bd55b7602d97049e8dca"",""53e999d2b7602d9702216bed"",""53e9b66cb7602d97041d28b0"",""53e9b055b7602d9703abc5ef"",""53e9a495b7602d9702db7dca"",""53e9be21b7602d9704adc521"",""53e9b917b7602d9704502363"",""53e9a6c3b7602d9702ff6417"",""53e999e7b7602d970222f41f"",""53e9ae2fb7602d9703846af1"",""599c7e03601a182cd286db55"",""53e9be0fb7602d9704ac948c"",""53e9afe8b7602d9703a393d8"",""53e9b3b7b7602d9703e9f438"",""53e99967b7602d97021aa8bb"",""53e9a894b7602d97031e2fd9""]",Efficient link scheduling for rechargeable wireless ad hoc and sensor networks.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1687-1499-2013-223"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1186/1687-1499-2013-223"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036f27cea80f954168665"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""EURASIP J.

53e99a86b7602d97022fc5b1,"Learning causal relations from observational data is a fundamental task in knowledge discovery. Recently, an Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI framework is proposed, which represents causal relations by deterministic functions, defines causal mechanisms by a cause-mapping independence postulate and learns causal directions by an information geometry formulation. Observing IGCI's limitation in representing general causal relations and its ambiguity in inferring causal directions, we generalize IGCI's original postulate, and propose a new dependence causal inference (DCI method where linear correlation and a new cross likelihood (CL measure are introduced. We prove that CL dependence measure incorporates IGCI as its special case in some sense. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data verify the effectiveness of our generalization and methods, and show that our method is more robust to disturbances on real data sets. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","[{""_id"":""53f473e6dabfaedd74e9f28e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Dingcheng Feng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542abb25dabfae2b4e1384cf"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Feng Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54057780dabfae92b41d7a6d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wenli Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1142/S0218213013500127,"[""Information geometry"",""Causal inference"",""Computer science"",""Principal stratification"",""Theoretical computer science"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Knowledge extraction"",""Causal system"",""Ambiguity"",""Machine learning"",""Causal model"",""Special case""]",,17936349,3,"[""causal inference"",""cross likelihood"",""deterministic"",""information geometry""]",en,0,null,null,null,"[""53e9a154b7602d9702a459c2"",""53e99d0cb7602d97025c0e91"",""5c7788fd4895d9cbc61ef876"",""53e99f77b7602d97028489f1"",""53e99a98b7602d9702312e43"",""53e9b3abb7602d9703e8b169"",""53e99d45b7602d97025fc7e9"",""53e9b181b7602d9703c0952c"",""53e9ad18b7602d97036f90ff"",""53e9bd45b7602d97049d28e5"",""53e99c84b7602d97025369d3"",""53e9ae76b7602d97038952d3"",""53e9b9c0b7602d97045b32dc"",""5c77d7394895d9cbc659358d"",""53e9a0adb7602d9702994649"",""53e9b2eab7602d9703da3451"",""53e9ab69b7602d9703504a05"",""558a3ccee4b037c08755f324"",""53e9b43db7602d9703f3a053"",""53e9bdb2b7602d9704a5eaac"",""53e9acadb7602d9703688ce3"",""53e9b159b7602d9703bdcfc7"",""53e9a806b7602d9703148de2"",""53e9b600b7602d97041549ac""]",Learning Deterministic Causal Relations.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218213013500127""]","{""_id"":""54825292582fc50b5e05d7e6"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",22,2013
53e99aa5b7602d970231d919,"Pedestrian detection is a fundamental problem in video surveillance and has achieved great progress in recent years. However, training a generic detector performing well in a great variety of scenes has been approved to be very difficult. On the other hand, exhausting manual labeling effort for each specific scene to achieve high accuracy of detection is not acceptable especially for video surveillance applications. In order to alleviate the manual labeling effort without scarifying accuracy of detection, we propose a transfer learning framework to automatically train a scene-specific pedestrian detector starting from a pre-trained generic detector. In our framework, sparse coding is proposed to calculate similarities between source samples and a small set of selected target samples by using the former as dictionary. The similarities are later used to calculate weights of source samples. The weights of initially detected target samples are calculated in a similar way but using the selected target dataset as dictionary. By using these weighted samples during re-training process, our framework can efficiently get a scene-specific pedestrian detector. Our experiments on VIRAT dataset show that our trained scene-specific pedestrian detector performs well and it is comparable with the detector trained on a large number of training samples manually labeled from the target scene. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""53f42d0adabfaedce54c03c1"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Feidie Liang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""56cb18aac35f4f3c6565a24b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Sheng Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5444f7dcdabfae862d9fb199"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yu Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5409589adabfae8faa683cb3"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qi Han"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f63b08dabfae3ddd3fa719"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jintao Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_26,"[""Computer vision"",""Pedestrian"",""Pattern recognition"",""Computer science"",""Neural coding"",""Transfer of learning"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Pedestrian detection"",""Detector"",""Small set""]",,16113349,2,"[""pedestrian detection"",""sparse coding"",""transfer learning""]",en,4,282,272,null,"[""53e9a2b9b7602d9702bc019e"",""53e9af2db7602d970396bf13"",""558be777e4b00c3c48df2686"",""558ad706e4b031bae1f9fda7"",""53e99cc2b7602d97025798db"",""53e9992bb7602d970216a206"",""558c20f4e4b02b9f07a54114"",""53e9b18fb7602d9703c19025"",""53e99b26b7602d97023be50b"",""53e9b9fbb7602d97045fa4e7"",""53e99b10b7602d97023a5578"",""53e9b27bb7602d9703d213ed"",""558b515ae4b0b32fcb3bface"",""53e9a95db7602d97032b5715"",""53e998b8b7602d97020f1238"",""53e9a2e5b7602d9702bf0c1c"",""53e9bafbb7602d9704736538"",""53e99a0eb7602d970225d18a"",""53e9a04ab7602d97029326c3"",""53e99f41b7602d970280f059"",""56d92c53dabfae2eeedfb6ba"",""53e9a675b7602d9702fa31d2"",""53e9b8f5b7602d97044d7acf"",""558b016584ae84d265c0ee66"",""53e9a64ab7602d9702f7ab9c"",""558a3988e4b037c08755e098""]",A Sparse Coding Based Transfer Learning Framework for Pedestrian Detection.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_26""]","{""_id"":""53a72cac20f7420be8c4c673"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Conference on Multimedia Modeling"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7733,2013

We employed a multi-case study method in this exploratory research with the objectives of defining individual level ERP assimilation and identifying key influential factors. Interviews with ERP users at all levels in five organizations revealed four key drivers: influence of supervisors, performance evaluation schemes, intrinsic motivation, and perceived usefulness, as well as two significant moderators: job specifications and individual absorptive capacity. Moreover, evidence suggests a potential relationship between individual level and organizational level ERP assimilations. Our findings highlight the importance of individual level assimilation within a firm in the post-implementation phase and provide managerial insights on how firms could improve ERP assimilation at the individual level that could impact the organizational level assimilation.","[{""_id"":""562c6f2945cedb3398c218f7"",""bio"":null,""email"":""liuluning@hit.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Luning Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Management Science and Engineering, School of Management, Harbin Institute of Technology,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542e8b8fdabfae4a9e492759"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yuqiang Feng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Management Science and Engineering, School of Management, Harbin Institute of Technology,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42da7dabfaee43ebc85dc"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qing Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Supply Chain and Information Systems, College of Business, Iowa State University,Ames,U.S.A."",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2821c455f439fe3c5fd"",""orgs"":[""Iowa State Univ, Coll Business, Dept Supply Chain & Informat Syst, Ames, IA USA""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f44c1edabfaec09f1dfbb3"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaojian Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Beijing Seeyon Software Co.,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Beijing Seeyon Software Co, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1057/ejis.2010.66,"[""Enterprise resource planning"",""Organizational performance"",""Accounting information system"",""Soft systems methodology"",""Knowledge management"",""Psychology"",""Absorptive capacity"",""Exploratory research"",""Strategic information system"",""Transactional leadership""]",,14769344,2,"[""enterprise resource planning (erp"",""individual level assimilation"",""multi-case study"",""organizational level assimilation""]",en,84,200,186,null,"[""53e9aa41b7602d97033b03af"",""53e9b0c7b7602d9703b3b994"",""53e9bac9b7602d97046f4c7c"",""53e9b2d2b7602d9703d80897"",""56d91460dabfae2eee501615"",""53e99abdb7602d9702339c35"",""53e9b873b7602d9704440020"",""555040f545ce0a409eb37d8a"",""53e9aeddb7602d970390574d"",""53e9a4c8b7602d9702dea9da"",""53e9bcefb7602d9704976454"",""53e9b48fb7602d9703f998f7"",""53e9b6a2b7602d97042182ba"",""53e9b07db7602d9703ae6be9"",""53e9a849b7602d9703194ea4"",""53e99e28b7602d97026ea478"",""53e99f27b7602d97027f4804"",""53e9a515b7602d9702e39f7f"",""53e9af5ab7602d970399c374"",""53e99818b7602d9702030fa1"",""53e9b6d1b7602d97042607ea"",""53e9afd3b7602d9703a24bfc"",""53e99bf7b7602d970249f245"",""53e9ab78b7602d970351a4b1"",""56d91460dabfae2eee50166d"",""53e99e71b7602d9702735f39"",""56d8449adabfae2eeea3f668"",""53e9b24eb7602d9703cf0d3a""]",From transactional user to VIP: how organizational and cognitive factors affect ERP assimilation at individual level,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/ejis.2010.66"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1057/ejis.2010.66"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036e27cea80f954163f17"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""EJIS"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",20,2011
53e99a74b7602d97022e2e16,"Rank-4 order diffusion tensor imaging (DT4 has been shown to be able to capture complex local tissue structures, for example, crossing fibers, but it cannot ensure the positive-definite property of diffusion. As a result, the positive-definite rank-4 order diffusion tensor imaging was presented to guarantee the positive-definite property. However, a comprehensive comparison that concerns SNR of Rician noise, effect of the numbers of gradient directions and the ability of detecting IVOH between DT4 and PDT4 has never been performed. To overcome these limitations, a comprehensive comparison between the two methods is made. Results show that it can help to determine whether the applied noise is close to the clinical application by estimating corresponding SNRs. Compared with DT4, PDT4 can achieve better result in terms of fiber error, standard deviation (SD of generalized trace (GT and generalized anisotropy (GA. PDT4 can increase the values of GA and scaled entropy, especially in nonwhite matter areas. Thus this study comes to conclusions as follows. The relationship between SNR and SD of Rician noise should be considered. PDT4 can achieve higher accuracy and better stability, but the advantage will become unobvious with increasing of sample directions and SNR. PDT4 will detect fake IVOH in nonwhite matter areas. The works in this article can provide an optimized plan for making sampling scheme and choosing proper imaging methods.

 to retailers, transportation, and two-echelon inventory over an infinite planning horizon. We structure this problem as a
 two-stage nonlinear discrete optimization problem. The first stage decides the warehouses to open and the second decides the
 warehouse-retailer assignments and two-echelon inventory replenishment strategies. Our modeling strategy incorporates various
 probable scenarios in the integrated multi-echelon supply chain distribution network design to identify solutions that minimize
 the first stage costs plus the expected second stage costs. The two-echelon inventory cost considerations result in a nonlinear
 objective which we linearize with an exponential number of variables. We solve the problem using column generation. Our computational

53e99a8cb7602d97023025b8,"Hashing for large scale image retrieval has become more and more popular because of its improvement in computational speed and storage reduction. Spectral Hashing (SH is a very efficient unsupervised hashing method through mapping similar images to similar binary codes. However, it doesn't take the non-neighbor points into consideration, and its assumption of uniform data distribution is usually not true. In this paper, we propose a local linear spectral hashing framework that minimizes the average Hamming distance with a new local neighbor matrix, which can guarantee the mapping not only from neighbor images to neighbor codes, but also from non-neighbor images to non-neighbor codes. Based on the framework, we utilize three linear methods to handle the proposed problem, including orthogonal hashing, non-orthogonal hashing, and sequential hashing. The experiments on two huge datasets demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our methods. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""562d532945cedb3398dc5bcf"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9079"",""name"":""Kang Zhao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shanghai Jiaotong University(Shanghai Jiaotong University,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai Jiaotong Univ.,Shanghai,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f38fecdabfae4b34a4eb73"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9079"",""name"":""Dengxiang Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shanghai Jiaotong University(Shanghai Jiaotong University,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai Jiaotong Univ.,Shanghai,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a5358dabfae646d55017d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c9079"",""name"":""Hongtao Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shanghai Jiaotong University(Shanghai Jiaotong University,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Shanghai Jiaotong Univ.,Shanghai,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b54b1c455f439fe502b0"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-42051-1_36,"[""Computer science"",""Matrix (mathematics"",""Binary code"",""Local linear"",""Image retrieval"",""Algorithm"",""Hamming distance"",""Eigendecomposition of a matrix"",""Hash function"",""Spectral hashing""]",,16113349,3,"[""eigenvalue decomposition"",""hamming distance"",""image retrieval"",""spectral hashing""]",en,5,290,283,null,"[""53e9b1ffb7602d9703c92f9f"",""53e9bd3fb7602d97049cf87a"",""558c5f3184ae6766fdf2b1db"",""53e99cb5b7602d970256bf6e"",""558b409584ae84d265c257a6"",""558a4111e4b037c087560c13"",""53e99d2fb7602d97025e3847"",""53e9a767b7602d97030a1b9f"",""53e99c7cb7602d970252d32c""]",Local Linear Spectral Hashing.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-42051-1_36""]","{""_id"":""53a72d5220f7420be8c611c4"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Conference on Neural Information Processing"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ICONIP (3"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",8228,2013

         mechanisms in this scheme, which are the fixed slow start threshold (ssthresh and
         the mechanism of changing a group representative (acker. Our experiments have revealed
         the fact that these mechanisms can lead to the unfairness of pgmcc under some network
         conditions. In this paper, two new mechanisms have been proposed to replace the original
         ones. One mechanism is to make the sender adapt the value of ssthresh to the network
         conditions to mimic the action of TCP, and in order to avoid being more aggressive
         than TCP, the other one is to make the sender reduce the congestion window by half
         when the acker changes. Our experiment results, parts of which are discussed in this
         paper, show that the modified pgmcc can achieve better performance than the original

53e99a8cb7602d97023017b2,"Precise facial feature extraction is essential to the high-level face recognition and expression analysis. This paper presents
 a novel method for the real-time geometric facial feature extraction from live video. In this paper, the input image is viewed
 as a weighted graph. The segmentation of the pixels corresponding to the edges of facial components of the mouth, eyes, brows,
 and nose is implemented by means of random walks on the weighted graph. The graph has an 8-connected lattice structure and
 the weight value associated with each edge reflects the likelihood that a random walker will cross that edge. The random walks
 simulate an anisotropic diffusion process that filters out the noise while preserving the facial expression pixels. The seeds
 for the segmentation are obtained from a color and motion detector. The segmented facial pixels are represented with linked
 lists in the original geometric form and grouped into different parts corresponding to facial components. For the convenience
 of implementing high-level vision, the geometric description of facial component pixels is further decomposed into shape and
 registration information. Shape is defined as the geometric information that is invariant under the registration transformation,
 such as translation, rotation, and isotropic scale. Statistical shape analysis is carried out to capture global facial features
 where the Procrustes shape distance measure is adopted. A Bayesian approach is used to incorporate high-level prior knowledge
 of face structure. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of real-time extraction of precise geometric
 facial features from live video. The feature extraction is robust against the illumination changes, scale variation, head
 rotations, and hand interference.","[{""_id"":""542984b6dabfaec70818ce25"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zhao_jieyu@nbu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c90e5"",""name"":""Jieyu Zhao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Ningbo University(Ningbo University,Ningbo,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b4151c455f439fe4778c"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-008-0049-6,"[""Anisotropic diffusion"",""Facial recognition system"",""Computer vision"",""Pattern recognition"",""Segmentation"",""Statistical shape analysis"",""Feature extraction"",""Facial expression"",""Random walker algorithm"",""Pixel"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Mathematics""]",,18622836,5,"[""anisotropic diffusion"",""bayesian approach"",""face recognition"",""real time"",""random walk"",""facial expression"",""feature extraction""]",en,0,498,489,null,"[""56d835a8dabfae2eee3dedce"",""53e9bcc1b7602d97049453e4"",""558a687c84ae84d265bd6ec8"",""558a410ce4b037c087560bff"",""53e9addab7602d97037e19f1"",""53e9a6a6b7602d9702fdd057"",""53e9a9e6b7602d970334c570"",""558abe82e4b037c08758e5c5"",""53e9b5fab7602d970414a5a0"",""53e9a7b3b7602d97030ee204"",""53e9af87b7602d97039d0ed9"",""53e9afe8b7602d9703a3af5a"",""53e9af40b7602d9703980429"",""53e9b083b7602d9703aec2d0""]",Live facial feature extraction.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-008-0049-6"",""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/43949113628"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-008-0049-6"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b77cea80f95414b7df"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Science in China Series F: Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",51,2008
53e99a43b7602d97022a054e,"Delay consideration has been a major issue in design and test of high performance digital circuits. The assumption of input
 signal change occurring only when all internal nodes are stable restricts the increase of clock frequency. It is no longer
 true for wave pipelining circuits. However, previous logical delay models are based on the assumption. In addition, the stable
 time of a robust delay test generally depends on the longest sensitizable path delay. Thus, a new delay model is desirable.
 This paper explores the necessity first. Then, Boolean process to analytically describe the logical and timing behavior of
 a digital circuit is reviewed. The concept of sensitization is redefined precisely in this paper. Based on the new concept
 of sensitization, an analytical delay model is introduced. As a result, many untestable delay faults under the logical delay
 model can be tested if the output waveforms can be sampled at more time points. The longest sensitizable path length is computed
 for circuit design and delay test.","[{""_id"":""543404aedabfaeba807dedf8"",""bio"":null,""email"":""min@mimi.cnc.ac.cn"",""gid"":""5b86a1efe1cd8e14a3c1649e"",""name"":""Yinghua Min"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Chinese Academy of Sciences Center for Fault-Tolerant Computing, CAD Lab., Institute of Computing Technology P.O.

In order to strengthen the parallelism without simply increasing the area, we propose a luma-chroma parallel method. Meanwhile, this work reduces the number of processing cycles, the amount of external memory traffic and the working frequency, by using triple four-stage pipeline filters and a luma-chroma interlaced sequence. Furthermore, it eliminates most unnecessary off-chip memory bandwidth with a highly reusable memory scheme, and adopts a ""slide window"" buffer scheme.

53e99a85b7602d97022fa0f0,"To determine the relative pose between an object and a single camera using 2D-to-3D point correspondences, a kind of iterative
 methods based on inverse projection ray approach is proposed. An iterative algorithm which is divided into depth recovery
 stage and absolute orientation stage is also proposed. In the first stage, the optimal translation vector is first computed
 in terms of rotation matrix via least square method, then the depths of the observed points are estimated by projecting the
 estimated point orthogonally to the inverse projection ray defined by the image point, and finally 3D points are reconstructed
 using the estimated depths from previous step. In the second stage, the optimal rotation matrix is estimated by applying Umeyama
 algorithm to fitting of the 3D model points and 3D estimated points. The above two stages are repeated until the result converges.
 The global convergence of the two-stage iterative algorithm is proven based on the global convergence theorem. Finally, a
 spacecraft docking application is implemented to test the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithm by mathematical
 simulation and physical simulation.","[{""_id"":""56cb18bdc35f4f3c6565f97f"",""bio"":null,""email"":""sjzhang@hit.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b869197e1cd8e14a353750c"",""name"":""ShiJie Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Harbin Institute of Technology Research Center of Satellite Technology Harbin 150080 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Res Ctr Satellite Technol, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869197e1cd8e14a353750c"",""name"":""XiBin Cao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Harbin Institute of Technology Research Center of Satellite Technology Harbin 150080 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Res Ctr Satellite Technol, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54344f20dabfaeb43f2b8d2f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869197e1cd8e14a353750c"",""name"":""Fan Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Harbin Institute of Technology Research Center of Satellite Technology Harbin 150080 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29b1c455f439fe3d046"",""orgs"":[""Harbin Inst Technol, Res Ctr Satellite Technol, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa0b77dabfae7f97b025fe"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86c0ffe1cd8e14a396893f"",""name"":""Liang He"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shanghai Aerospace Control Engineering Institute Shanghai 200233 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Shanghai Aerosp Control Engn Inst, Shanghai 200233, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-010-4017-6,"[""Convergence (routing"",""Computer vision"",""Rotation matrix"",""Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm"",""Iterative method"",""3D pose estimation"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Translation (geometry"",""Mathematics"",""Focus (optics"",""Iterative closest point""]",,18622836,8,"[""least square method"",""iterative algorithm"",""pose estimation"",""iteration method"",""monocular vision""]",en,14,1696,1682,null,"[""53e9a396b7602d9702ca71c4"",""53e9b572b7602d97040ab34c"",""53e9a4a3b7602d9702dc6815"",""5488f0ed45ce471f90957d35"",""53e9a03bb7602d97029203f7"",""53e99c60b7602d970251035d"",""53e9af06b7602d970393d6a8"",""53e9a88db7602d97031dbcde"",""53e9982cb7602d970205301a"",""53e9a957b7602d97032ae3f2"",""53e9b35ab7602d9703e34d27"",""53e99905b7602d9702142279"",""558ab7dae4b037c08758bfdd"",""53e9afcdb7602d9703a226f3"",""53e99e4db7602d97027139fc"",""53e9bd0bb7602d9704992023"",""557d44426feeaa8086da8f40""]",Monocular vision-based iterative pose estimation algorithm from corresponding feature points,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-010-4017-6"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-010-4017-6"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b77cea80f95414b7de"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",53,2010

One is with a single authoritity, and the other is with multi authorities. Not only our schemes are proved secure as the previous ABE schemes, they also provide a verification property. This could not be trivially solved, such as trying random decryption. Adding the verification property has a few advantages: first, it allows the user to immediately check the correctness of the keys, if not, he only needs the authority to resend the corresponding shares, especially, in multiauthority case, if the key does not pass the check, the user only needs to ask the particular authority to resend its own part, without need to go to all the authorities; second, if the keys pass the verification but the user still does not rightly decrypt out the message, something might be wrong with the attributes or ciphertexts, then, the user has to contact with the encryptor; third, the trick used in this paper could also be used in the ciphertext-policy scenario.

53e99ab9b7602d9702336b0a,"Multicore processor architectures have become ubiquitous in today's computing platforms, especially in parallel computing installations, with their power and cost advantages. While the technology trend continues towards having hundreds of cores on a chip in the foreseeable future, an urgent question posed to system designers as well as application users is whether applications can receive sufficient support on today's operating systems for them to scale to many cores. To this end, people need to understand the strengths and weaknesses on their support on scalability and to identify major bottlenecks limiting the scalability, if any. As open-source operating systems are of particular interests in the research and industry communities, in this paper we choose three operating systems (Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD to systematically evaluate and compare their scalability by using a set of highly-focused microbenchmarks for broad and detailed understanding their scalability on an AMD 32-core system. We use system profiling tools and analyze kernel source codes to find out the root cause of each observed scalability bottleneck. Our results reveal that there is no single operating system among the three standing out on all system aspects, though some system(s can prevail on some of the system aspects. For example, Linux outperforms Solaris and FreeBSD significantly for file-descriptor- and process-intensive operations. For applications with intensive sockets creation and deletion operations, Solaris leads FreeBSD, which scales better than Linux. With the help of performance tools and source code instrumentation and analysis, we find that synchronization primitives protecting shared data structures in the kernels are the major bottleneck limiting system scalability.

A novel diagonal loading-based method is proposed to optimize the waveform covariance matrix for maximizing the worst-case output signal-interference-noise ratio (SINR over the convex uncertainty set such that the worst-case detection performance of MIMO-STAP can be maximized. The resultant nonlinear optimization problem is reformulated as a semidefinite programming problem, which can be solved very efficiently.

It is shown that, the aperiodic quadriphase Zcomplementary pairs are normally better than binary ones of the same length, in terms of the number of Z-complementary pairs, and the maximum zero correlation zone. New notions of elementary transformations on quadriphase sequences and elementary operations on sets of quadriphase Zcomplementary sequences are presented. In particular, new methods for analyzing the relations among the formulas relative to sets of quadriphase Zcomplementary sequences and for describing the sets are proposed. The existence problem of Z-complementary pairs of quadriphase sequences with zero correlation zone equal to 2, 3, and 4 is investigated. Constructions of sets of quadriphase Z-complementary sequences and their mates are given.

53e99af2b7602d970237cdcd,"Multicast in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs is an attractive mechanism for delivering data to multiple receivers as it saves bandwidth. To guarantee the security of multicast, the group key is used to encrypt and decrypt the packages. However, providing key management services in WSNs is complicated because sensor nodes possess limited resources of computing, storage and communication. To address the balance between security and limited resources, a multicast group key management protocol based on the weight-balanced 2-3 tree is proposed to generate, distribute, and update the group key securely and efficiently. The decentralized group key management method is employed. A weight-balanced 2-3 key tree is formed in every subgroup. Instead of using the conventional symmetric and non-symmetric encryption algorithms, the Maximum Distance Separable (MDS code technique is used to distribute the multicast key dynamically. During the key updating, a series of adjustment rules are summarized to keep the tree weight-balanced, where pseudo-nodes as leaves are added to reduce the computation and communication complexity. Compared with some other group key management protocols, our scheme shows higher superiority on security and performance. © 2011 International Information Institute.","[{""_id"":""53f83318dabfae9467ddd66b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lin Yao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2711345362""},{""_id"":""53f47ebcdabfae9126cc432c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Bing Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2492615571""},{""_id"":""540fd2b5dabfae450f4a9429"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Feng Xia"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2101137769""},{""_id"":""541079b4dabfae44f08b1c5b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guowei Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2155117955""},{""_id"":""54454c7cdabfae862da13bde"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiang Lin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2670192654""}]",null,"[""2–3 tree"",""Computer science"",""Group key management"",""Computer network"",""Multicast"",""Wireless sensor network""]",,13448994,10,"[""2-3 tree"",""group key management"",""multicast"",""wireless sensor networks""]",en,5,3278,3261,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/362/1224/602/53e99af2b7602d970237cdcd_0.pdf,null,A Group Key Management Protocol Based on Weight-Balanced 2-3 Tree for Wireless Sensor Networks,"[""http://dx.doi.org/null"",""http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1465"",""https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1465""]","{""_id"":null,""issn"":null,""name"":""Information-an International Interdisciplinary Journal"",""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Information-an International Interdisciplinary Journal"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":""12613394"",""src"":null,""t"":""J"",""type"":null}",1205.1465,2011

To address this problem, we propose a spectrum sensing method that exploits the similarity of PDFs of two time-adjacent detected data sets with cross entropy, while accounting for achieving the detection performance of LRT which is Neyman-Pearson optimal in detecting the primary user. We show that the detection performance of the proposed method asymptotically approximates that of LRT in detecting the PU. The simulation results confirm our analysis.

53e99ac4b7602d9702342d23,"An n-dimensional Bijective Connection graph (in brief BC graph is a regular graph with 2n nodes and n2n-1 edges. The n-dimensional hypercube, crossed cube, Möbius cube, etc. are some examples of the n-dimensional BC graphs. In this paper, we propose a general method to study the edge-pancyclicity and path-embeddability of the BC graphs. First, we prove that a path of length l with dist(Xn, x, y + 2 ≤ l ≤ 2n - 1 can be embedded between x and y with dilation 1 in Xn for x, y ∈ V(Xn with x ≠ y in Xn, where Xn (n ≥ 4 is a n-dimensional BC graph satisfying the three specific conditions and V(Xn is the node set of Xn. Furthermore, by this result, we can claim that Xn is edge-pancyclic. Lastly, we show that these results can be applied to not only crossed cubes and Möbius cubes, but also other BC graphs except crossed cubes and Möbius cubes. So far, the research on edge-pancyclicity and path-embeddability has been limited in some specific interconnection architectures such as crossed cubes, Möbius cubes. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In order to simulate human's paralleled visual neural perception, many subregions are sampling from an image, where each one is considered as a set of colors from a codebook, which is a color palette for the image. We assume salient pixels would appear spatial adjacent more possibly, therefore in a same sub-region, while less salient pixels would either. Consequently, all the sub-regions are clustered into two assumed topics with probabilities: ""salient""/ ""non-salient"", while ""salient"" one is decided to give saliency value of each pixel according to its posterior conditional probability. Our method will give a global saliency map with full resolution, and experiments illustrate it is competitive with the state-of-art methods. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""542aa7fbdabfae646d57cc6f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guang Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a47c1dabfae61d4963236"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xi Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f446e5dabfaee43ec7fbbd"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jinpeng Yue"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f479d7dabfae8a6845c41f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhongzhi Shi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35725-1_16,"[""Computer vision"",""Fuzzy clustering"",""Conditional probability"",""Pattern recognition"",""Salience (neuroscience"",""Computer science"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Probabilistic latent semantic analysis"",""Pixel"",""Topic model"",""Codebook"",""Salient""]",,16113349,1,"[""probabilistic latent semantic analysis"",""salient region detection""]",en,0,184,174,null,"[""53e9b5e0b7602d970412da0b"",""53e99bd5b7602d9702480674"",""53e9a202b7602d9702b03600"",""53e9b94db7602d9704539d16"",""53e99aacb7602d9702324e85"",""53e99d9eb7602d970265b324"",""53e9b253b7602d9703cf155a"",""53e9b24db7602d9703cec8f0"",""558a834a84ae84d265be0ca7"",""53e99a92b7602d9702306de0"",""53e9b91eb7602d9704504719"",""53e9bbdbb7602d9704829159"",""53e9b451b7602d9703f4df12"",""53e99b16b7602d97023ac236"",""53e9a7d5b7602d970311389e"",""53e9aadfb7602d9703460d7d"",""53e9b8dab7602d97044babaf"",""53e9b5bcb7602d970410705f"",""53e9b755b7602d97042f52e4"",""53e9b8c6b7602d97044a3514""]",Exploit Spatial Relationships among Pixels for Saliency Region Detection Using Topic Model.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35725-1_16""]","{""_id"":""555037617cea80f95418422a"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Conference on Multimedia Modeling"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7732,2013
53e99ac4b7602d9702341d7d,"We develop and test a theoretical model to investigate the adoption of government-to-government (G2G information systems in public administration organizations. Specifically, this model explains how top management commitment (TMC mediates the impact of external institutional pressures on internal organizational resource allocation, which finally leads to the adoption decision. The hypotheses were tested using survey data from public administration organizations in China. Results from partial least squares analyses suggest that coercive and normative pressures positively affect TMC, which then positively affects financial and information technology (IT human resources in the G2G adoption process. In turn, financial and IT human resources are confirmed to positively affect the intention to adopt G2G. Surprisingly, we do not find support for our hypothesis that mimetic pressures directly influence TMC. Rather, a post hoc analysis implies that mimetic pressures indirectly influence TMC via the influence of coercive pressures. Our findings provide important managerial implications for public administration organizations. © 2013 Operational Research Society Ltd.","[{""_id"":""53f43704dabfaeee229b0757"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Daqing Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""School of Information Management and Engineering, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics,Shanghai,People's Republic of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e37f"",""orgs"":[""Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat Management & Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f556ccdabfae963d25c2bc"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jin Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Information Systems,National University of Singapore,Singapore"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2971c455f439fe3cecb"",""orgs"":[""Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Informat Syst, Singapore 117548, Singapore""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4ccd8dabfaee579783535"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lihua Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Information Management and Information Systems,School of Management, Fudan University,Shanghai,People's Republic of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c861"",""orgs"":[""Fudan Univ, Dept Informat Management & Informat Syst, Sch Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54068dafdabfae92b4211318"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Cheng Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":""0000-0002-8277-5138"",""org"":""Department of Information Management and Information Systems,School of Management, Fudan University,Shanghai,People's Republic of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c861"",""orgs"":[""Fudan Univ, Dept Informat Management & Informat Syst, Sch Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1057/ejis.2012.28,"[""Information system"",""Public administration"",""Management information systems"",""Resource-based view"",""Institutional theory"",""Economics"",""Soft systems methodology"",""Information technology"",""Information science"",""Knowledge management"",""Strategic information system""]",,14769344,2,"[""e-government"",""financial resources"",""g2g adoption"",""institutional pressures"",""it human resources"",""top management commitment"",""information science"",""information system"",""soft system methodology"",""management information systems"",""information technology"",""health information systems"",""information management"",""geographic information systems"",""information systems technology"",""information systems management"",""strategic information systems"",""information security"",""computer information systems"",""accounting information systems"",""business information systems"",""computer information technology"",""management science"",""information management system"",""business model""]",en,95,234,221,null,"[""56d91461dabfae2eee50188c"",""53e9b98ab7602d970457c39c"",""53e9b2d2b7602d9703d80897"",""56d91460dabfae2eee501615"",""53e99e38b7602d97026f8782"",""53e9b009b7602d9703a647da"",""53e99d13b7602d97025c4f6c"",""53e99d8eb7602d970264aaa4"",""53e9b002b7602d9703a5d819"",""53e9a424b7602d9702d425b8"",""53e99f7fb7602d97028523ed"",""5c77738a4895d9cbc60e09b3"",""53e9b46fb7602d9703f6fef4"",""53e9ab78b7602d970351eda1"",""53e9a7e3b7602d9703120362"",""53e9a130b7602d9702a1dd21"",""53e9bc36b7602d97048a90f3"",""53e9b8aeb7602d970448b82f"",""53e9a58cb7602d9702eb54c8"",""53e9b6d6b7602d97042662ae"",""53e9a1c9b7602d9702ac15bb"",""53e99953b7602d970219495d"",""53e9a24db7602d9702b57f68"",""53e9b75ab7602d97042fd968"",""5736968d6e3b12023e5979dd"",""53e9aefcb7602d970392eb4e"",""53e9bb44b7602d9704785d7d""]",E-government adoption in public administration organizations: integrating institutional theory perspective and resource-based view.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/ejis.2012.28"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1057/ejis.2012.28"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036e27cea80f954163f17"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""EJIS"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",22,2013
53e99abeb7602d970233f65e,"Constant traffic congestion consumes enormous amounts of energy and causes vastly increased journey times. Therefore, real-time traffic information is of great importance to the public because such information is invaluable to more efficient traffic control and travel planning. To obtain such information in metropolises like Shanghai, however, is very challenging due to the extraordinarily large scale and complexity of the underlying road network. In this paper, we propose a novel traffic estimation scheme utilizing surveillance cameras pervasively deployed in cities. With only a limited number of roads with cameras, we adopt a measurementbased traffic matrix (TM estimation method to infer the traffic conditions on those roads with no cameras. Extensively trace-driven simulations as well as field study results show that our scheme can achieve high accuracy with a very limited number of measurements. The accuracy of our measurement-based algorithm outperforms the traditional speed-based and model-based approaches by up to 50%. © 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[{""_id"":""56cb189cc35f4f3c656558c1"",""bio"":null,""email"":""gt_xue@sjtu.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Guangtao Xue"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f564b5dabfae6076f805dc"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ke Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Baidu Corp, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Baidu Corp, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4399bdabfaefedbae67af"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qi He"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f3a22adabfae4b34ac0ea9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hongzi Zhu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":[""Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11704-012-2051-9,"[""Computer science"",""Simulation"",""Floating car data"",""Real-time computing"",""Traffic congestion reconstruction with Kerner's three-phase theory"",""Traffic conditions"",""Traffic congestion""]",,16737466,5,"[""real-time traffic information"",""surveillance cameras"",""measurement-based traffic matrix estimation"",""topology pruning""]",en,3,559,547,null,"[""53e9a718b7602d970304c31c"",""53e9a547b7602d9702e6b3af"",""53e99ae7b7602d9702371e2a"",""53e99c52b7602d97024fe7e2"",""53e9b740b7602d97042d8c41"",""53e99de9b7602d97026abf64"",""53e9b0b2b7602d9703b21c94"",""53e9a7ffb7602d9703142ca0"",""53e9adc2b7602d97037c57c6"",""53e99ad1b7602d9702353e91""]",Real-time urban traffic information estimation with a limited number of surveillance cameras.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-012-2051-9"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11704-012-2051-9"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""53a72ff820f7420be8cd03aa"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Frontiers of Computer Science"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",6,2012

53e99af7b7602d97023819c7,"To establish a multicast connection in a wavelength routed optical network, two steps are needed under the multi-tree model. One is to construct a set of light-trees rooted at the source node such that in each of them at most a specified number of destination nodes are allowed to receive the data and every destination node must be designated in one of them to receive the data. The other is to assign a wavelength to each of the produced light-trees in such a way that two light-trees must be assigned two distinct wavelengths if they use a common link. In this paper we mainly study how to construct a multicast routing of minimal cost under the multi-tree model in optical networks, where the routing cost is total costs of the produced light-trees. We propose a 4-approximation algorithm for this NP-hard problem. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, the harmful and illegal content, such as pornography, violence, horror etc., permeates theWeb. Horror images, whose threat to children's health is no less than that from pornographic content, are nowadays neglected by existing Web filtering tools. This paper focuses on horror image recognition, which may further be applied to Web horror content filtering. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, the emotional attention mechanism is introduced into our work to detect emotional salient region in an image. And a topdown emotional saliency computation model is initially proposed based on color emotion and color harmony theories. Second, we present an Attention based Bag-of-Words (ABoW framework for image's emotion representation by combining the emotional saliency computation model and the Bag-of-Words model. Based on ABoW, a horror image recognition algorithm is given out. The experimental results on diverse real images collected from internet show that the proposed emotional saliency model and horror image recognition algorithm are effective.","[{""_id"":""54068d5cdabfae92b4210ec2"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86ab3ce1cd8e14a3fca902"",""name"":""Bing Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""National Lab of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, CAS, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4a440dabfaec65977b3ba"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86ab3ce1cd8e14a3fca902"",""name"":""Weiming Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""National Lab of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, CAS, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45f78dabfaee0d9c14537"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86a7dae1cd8e14a3e68454"",""name"":""Weihua Xiong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""OmniVision Technologies, Sunnyvale, CA"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3c11c455f439fe4514a"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542aa9b6dabfae61d499bd93"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86ab3ce1cd8e14a3fca902"",""name"":""Ou Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""National Lab of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, CAS, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4c6e1dabfaee57f77c1ee"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86ab3ce1cd8e14a3fca902"",""name"":""Wei Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""National Lab of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, CAS, Beijing, China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-19309-5_46,"[""Computer vision"",""Computer science"",""Color emotion"",""Salience (neuroscience"",""Filter (signal processing"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Real image"",""Pornography"",""Harmony (color"",""The Internet"",""Salient""]",,16113349,2,"[""proposed emotional saliency model"",""diverse real image"",""emotional attention mechanism"",""emotional saliency computation model"",""horror image"",""emotional salient region"",""horror etc."",""web horror content"",""horror image recognition"",""horror image recognition algorithm"",""image recognition"",""top down"",""bag of words"",""computer model""]",en,6,605,594,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/731/753/1667/53e99afdb7602d9702389123_0.pdf,"[""53e9b8fcb7602d97044e2995"",""53e9a202b7602d9702b03600"",""53e9b3dab7602d9703ec88ce"",""53e99aacb7602d9702324e85"",""53e99d3db7602d97025f052e"",""53e9aacab7602d970344af3c"",""558a834a84ae84d265be0ca7"",""53e99bd5b7602d9702480674"",""53e9a7d5b7602d970311389e"",""53e9ac12b7602d97035d22ea"",""53e9b010b7602d9703a678ea"",""53e9a5f0b7602d9702f1a2ff"",""558b0edfe4b031bae1fb48a3"",""53e9ab00b7602d970348375f""]",Horror image recognition based on emotional attention,"[""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/79952523765""]","{""_id"":""54824c66582fc50b5e008eb0"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Asian Conference on Computer Vision"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",6493,2011

This accomplishes the first of a possible, two-step process in solving the problem raised (LNCS, 1991, 530:

 any ω-algebraic meet-cpo D satisfying axioms M and I to be contained in a cartesian closed full sub-category using ω-algebraic meet-cpos with stable functions, it must not violate MI∞. We introduce a new class of domains called weakly distributive domains and show that for these domains to be in a cartesian
 closed category using ω-algebraic meet-cpos, property MI∞ must not be violated. Further, we demonstrate that principally distributive domains (those for which each principle ideal
 is distributive form a proper subclass of weakly distributive domains, and Birkhoff’s M

 5 (Introduction to Lattices and order, Cambridge Univ. Press, 2002 are weakly distributive (but non-distributive. Then, we

53e99acab7602d970234a432,"In this paper, a robust fractional order memory polynomial pre-distorter with two novel schemes to conduct digital base-band power amplifier pre-distortion is proposed. For the first scheme, fractional order terms are included in the conventional memory polynomial containing the odd and even order polynomial terms, which is called Scheme One. The second scheme, called Scheme Two, simply replaces even order polynomial terms with fractional order polynomial terms to improve the linear performance of power amplifiers. The mathematical expressions for these two schemes are derived. The computer simulations and numerical analysis show that, compared with the conventional pre-distortion methods, 11 dB and 8.5 dB more out-of-band suppression gain can be obtained by Scheme One and Scheme Two, respectively. Corresponding FPGA realization shows that the two schemes are cost-effective in terms of hardware resources.

However, the nodes can not obtain accurate location information due to the effect of measurement error. A new routing strategy using maximum expected distance and angle (MEDA algorithm is proposed to improve the performance and promote the successive transmission rate. We firstly introduce the expected distance and angle, and then we employ the principal component analysis to construct the object function for selecting the next hop node. We compare the proposed algorithm with maximum expectation within transmission range (MER and greedy routing scheme (GRS algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed MEDA algorithm outperforms the MER and GRS algorithms with higher successive transmission rate.

53e99afdb7602d970238b2b1,"Hydraulic thrust system is an important system on a shield tunneling machine. Pressure regulation of thrust cylinders is the most important function of thrust system during tunnel excavation. In this article, a hydraulic thrust system is illuminated, and a corresponding simulation model is carried out in order to study the system characteristics. Pressure regulation of a certain group's cylinders has a little influence of the other groups' cylinders. The influence will not affect the process much during tunnel excavation. Pump displacement may have a great effect on the pressure regulation. Oil supply flow rate should be adaptive to the system demand. A tough situation is simulated to explain how the pressure regulation works during tunnel excavation.","[{""_id"":""544852f7dabfae87b7e0a65d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86cd9ce1cd8e14a3f1c476"",""name"":""Zhibin Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power Transmission and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China 310027"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0e1"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5410d6e1dabfae44f08e77d3"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hbxie@zju.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86cd9ce1cd8e14a3f1c476"",""name"":""Haibo Xie"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power Transmission and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China 310027"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0e1"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""560c015d45cedb339745841a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86cd9ce1cd8e14a3f1c476"",""name"":""Huayong Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power Transmission and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China 310027"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0e1"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11465-011-0226-y,"[""Geotechnical engineering"",""Cylinder (engine"",""Excavation"",""Shield tunneling"",""System characteristics"",""Oil supply"",""Geology"",""Thrust"",""Volumetric flow rate""]",,20950241,3,"[""simulation model"",""flow rate""]",en,4,382,377,null,null,Simulation Analysis of Pressure Regulation of Hydraulic Thrust System on a Shield Tunneling Machine,"[""http://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/80052594650"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11465-011-0226-y""]","{""_id"":""548249f6582fc50b5dfdc668"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Frontiers of Mechanical Engineering"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":11}",6,2011
