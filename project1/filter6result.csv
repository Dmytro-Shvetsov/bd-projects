53e997d7b7602d9701fcbe22,"This paper deals with the output feedback sliding mode control for Itô stochastic time-delay systems. The system states are unmeasured, and the uncertainties are unmatched. A sliding mode control scheme is proposed based on the state estimates. By utilizing a novel switching function, the derivative of the switching function is ensured to be finite variation. It is shown that the sliding mode in the estimation space can be attained in finite time. The sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability (in probability of the overall closed-loop stochastic system is derived. Finally, a simulation example is shown to illustrate the proposed method.","[{""_id"":""53f4671bdabfaeb22f540492"",""bio"":null,""email"":""acniuyg@ecust.edu.cn"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Yugang Niu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f435f7dabfaee02acc6612"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b8695f7e1cd8e14a36fe2df"",""name"":""Daniel W.C.

53e997e4b7602d9701fdc448,"This paper presents a simulated annealing search procedure developed to solve job shop scheduling problems simultaneously
 subject to tardiness and inventory costs. The procedure is shown to significantly increase schedule quality compared to multiple
 combinations of dispatch rules and release policies, though at the expense of intense computational efforts. A meta-heuristic
 procedure is developed that aims at increasing the efficiency of simulated annealing by dynamically inflating the costs associated
 with major inefficiencies in the current solution. Three different variations of this procedure are considered. One of these
 variations is shown to yield significant reductions in computation time, especially on problems where search is more likely
 to get trapped in local minima. We analyze why this variation of the meta-heuristic is more effective than the others.","[{""_id"":""53f4a244dabfaedd74eb7441"",""bio"":null,""email"":""sadeh@cs.cmu.edu"",""gid"":""5b86b6d7e1cd8e14a34d48ad"",""name"":""Norman M.

53e997e8b7602d9701fdf4b5,"Flexible manufacturing systems have long been touted as an application area for supervisory control theory. Unfortunately, due to the typical exponential growth of state space with the number of interacting subsystem, concurrent systems such as manufacturing applications have, for the most part, remained beyond the reach of existing supervisory control theory tools. This paper demonstrates how, by imposing a hierarchical, modular, interface-based architecture on the system, signicant gains can be made in the size of applications that can be handled by supervisory control theory. We rst review Hierarchical Interface-based Supervisory Control (HISC, providing the theory necessary to motivate the creation of well dened, automata-based interfaces between components. This architecture permits the verication of global safety (controllability and non-blocking properties to be decomposed into a set of local checks, each of which only involves an individual component subsystem and its interface automata. The paper then provides a detailed description of how the theory can be applied to the design and verication of a e xible manufacturing system work cell. The work cell model is based upon the Atelier Inter- · etablissement de Productique (AIP e xible manufacturing workcell, a system that has been previously studied in the literature with limited success.","[{""_id"":""53f45f4ddabfaeb22f52134a"",""bio"":null,""email"":""leduc@mcmaster.ca"",""gid"":null,""name"":""R.

53e997f4b7602d9701ff74b1,"A new emerging test and measurement standard called AXIe, AdvancedTCA eXtensions for Instrumentation, is expected to find wide acceptance within the Automatic Test Equipment community as it offers many key benefits. It is expected that a large number of stimulus, measurement, signal conditioning, acquisition and processing modules will become available from a range of different suppliers. AXIe uses AdvancedTCA® as its base standard, but then borrows from test and measurement industry standards such as PXI, IVI, and LXI, which were designed to facilitate cooperation and plug-and-play interoperability between instrument suppliers. This enables AXIe systems to easily integrate with other test and measurement equipment. AXIe's large board footprint, available power and efficient cooling to the module payload allows high density in a 19-inch rack space, enabling the development of high-performance instrumentation in a density unmatched by other instrumentation form factors. Channel synchronization between modules is flexible and provided by AXIe's dual triggering structures: a parallel trigger bus, and radially-distributed, time-matched point-to-point trigger lines. Inter-module communication is also provided with a local bus between adjacent modules allowing data transfer rates up to 10 Gbits/s in each direction, for example between front-end digitizer modules and DSP banks. The AXIe form factor provides the power and cooling necessary to embed high performance computing. A range of compute blades are available today in an AdvancedTCA® form factor that provide low cost alternatives to the development of custom signal processing modules. The availability of both LAN and PCIe (PCI Express fabrics allow the interconnection between modules, as well as high industry-standard highperformance data paths to external host computer systems. AXIe delivers a powerful environment for custom module development for specific and unique applicati- - ons. As in the case of VXIbus and PXI before it, commercial development kits are expected to be offered from the industry.

Currently, control and coordination of UAVs typically involves multiple operators to control a single agent. The aim of this article is to invert this relationship, enabling a single pilot to control and coordinate a group of UAVs. Furthermore, decision support is provided to the pilot to facilitate effective control of the UAV team. In the scenario envisioned in this article, the human operator (the pilot is operating along-side a team of UAVs.

53e9984bb7602d970207a930,"One of the important reasons for ANSI X3J3's decision to adopt a “core plus modules” framework for FORTRAN is its concern for development of collateral standards in applications areas such as data management process control, and graphics. X3J3 does not have the resources to do the technical development of standards in all of these diverse areas. Therefore, it is important that X3J3 provide a scheme whereby collateral standards can be developed by groups outside of X3J3 and serve as “modules” attached to the “core” FORTRAN language in a standard way. X3J3's role in such collateral standards would be to ensure that the modules attach properly to the rest of the FORTRAN language, and that the work of different outside groups does not conflict.","[{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f44f4ddabfaec09f1eb302"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Dean Herington"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1145/800178.810142,null,,,,"[""data management"",""process control""]",en,0,,,null,null,Whither goeth fortran?,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/800178.810142"",""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/800178.810141""]","{""_id"":""53a72c6320f7420be8c44440"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ACM Annual Conference (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",,1978,conference,"[""Bruce Puerling"",""Lloyd W.

53e99885b7602d97020bf57d,"Typical animal locomotion is achieved by the rhythmical undulation of its body segments while interacting with its environment. It inspires the mechanical design of multilink locomotors. With different postures, a multilink system may present different locomotion gaits. Recently, a so-called natural oscillation gait was studied for multilink systems, and a class of biologically inspired controllers was designed for the achievement of the gait. In this paper, the theoretical design is experimentally applied on a mechanical multilink testbed of two posture configurations in rayfish-like flapping-wing motion and snake-like serpentine motion. The effectiveness of the design is cross examined by theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiments.","[{""_id"":""53f42d4adabfaedd74d3540c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Md Nurul Islam"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f450b1dabfaedd74e175ea"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhiyong Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1109/TRO.2014.2298926,"[""Mechanical design"",""Animal locomotion"",""Computer simulation"",""Gait"",""Simulation"",""Control theory"",""Testbed"",""Robot kinematics"",""Engineering"",""Mechanical system""]",,,3,"[""Oscillators"",""Joints"",""Mathematical model"",""Mechanical systems"",""Robot kinematics"",""Analytical models""]",en,5,771,765,null,"[""53e9bd7bb7602d9704a20f51"",""53e9b1f1b7602d9703c85242"",""53e9b70fb7602d97042a934f"",""53e9ac82b7602d9703655f5d"",""53e9b4a5b7602d9703fb5ca0"",""53e99960b7602d970219fc19"",""53e9b395b7602d9703e7b4f4"",""558c60dce4b00c3c48e1f624"",""53e99cb4b7602d9702565ec2"",""53e9ab5ab7602d97034f5311"",""53e9b1ddb7602d9703c6d9af"",""5488f5ea45ce471f909877cb"",""53e9b35ab7602d9703e36a73"",""53e9ba0bb7602d97046115ab"",""53e9b27bb7602d9703d21f14"",""53e9bad7b7602d9704703945"",""558a8bdb84ae84d265be3e72""]",Natural Gaits for Multilink Mechanical Systems,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2014.2298926"",""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2714096.2714382&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=685839393&CFTOKEN=21366888&preflayout=flat"",""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6727507"",""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6727507/""]","{""_id"":""5390a71b20f70186a0e88c46"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""IEEE Transactions on Robotics"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IEEE Transactions on Robotics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",30,2014,journal,"[""Md.

53e99893b7602d97020ca0ad,This brief introduces a new parametric modelling and identification method for linear time-varying systems using a block least mean square (LMS approach where the time-varying parameters are approximated using multi-wavelet basis functions. This approach can be applied to track rapidly or even sharply varying processes and is developed by combining wavelet approximation theory with a block LMS algorithm. Numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for dealing with severely nonstationary processes. Application of the proposed approach to a real mechanical system indicates better tracking capability of the multi-wavelet basis function algorithm compared with the normalized least squares or recursive least squares routines.,"[{""_id"":""56046b0e45cedb33963c00e9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yang Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42b27dabfaedce54a13b5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hua-liang Wei"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""562b049645cedb339896410c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""S.

53e998cdb7602d97021084bd,"Incorporating evidence based medicine (EBM into clinical practice requires clinicians to learn to efficiently gain access to clinical evidence and effectively appraise its validity. Even using current electronic systems, selecting literature-based data to solve a single patient-related problem can require more time than practicing physicians or residents can spare. Clinical librarians, as informationists, are uniquely suited to assist physicians in this endeavor.To improve support for evidence-based practice, we have developed a web-based EBM library consult service application (LCS. Librarians use the LCS system to provide full text evidence-based literature with critical appraisal in response to a clinical question asked by a remote physician. LCS uses an entirely Free/Open Source Software platform and will be released under a Free Software license. In the first year of the LCS project, the software was successfully developed and a reference implementation put into active use. Two years of evaluation of the clinical, educational, and attitudinal impact on physician-users and librarian staff are underway, and expected to lead to refinement and wide dissemination of the system.A web-based EBM library consult model may provide a useful way for informationists to assist clinicians, and is feasible to implement.","[{""_id"":""560208af45cedb3395ef964a"",""bio"":null,""email"":""alansz@uic.edu"",""gid"":""5b86a2cbe1cd8e14a3c68ab0"",""name"":""Alan Schwartz"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Medical Education, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, USA|Department of Pediatrics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, USA"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0e5"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46246dabfaedf436358dc"",""bio"":null,""email"":""walker@deafcode.com"",""gid"":""5b869588e1cd8e14a36d04b8"",""name"":""Gregory Millam"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Medical Education, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, USA"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b29c1c455f439fe3d0e5"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":""alansz@uic.edu"",""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1186/1472-6947-6-16,"[""Software license"",""Computer science"",""Knowledge management"",""Critical appraisal"",""Reference implementation"",""Software"",""Web application"",""Health informatics"",""Evidence-based medicine"",""The Internet""]",,1472-6947,1,"[""evidence based medicine"",""evidence based practice"",""health informatics""]",en,30,16,16,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e998cdb7602d97021084bd_0.pdf,null,A web-based library consult service for evidence-based medicine: Technical development.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-6-16"",""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16542453?report=xml&format=text"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1186/1472-6947-6-16""]","{""_id"":""555036bc7cea80f95414e742"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""BMC Med.

53e99931b7602d970216fe02,"In this paper, a nonconventional structure for a ""fuzzy"" controller is proposed. It does not require signal divi- sion, and it produces control surfaces similar to classical fuzzy controllers. The structure combines fuzzification, MIN operators, normalization, and weighted sum blocks. The fuzzy architecture is implemented as a VLSI chip using 2- m n-well technology. A new fuzzification circuit, which requires only one differential pair per membership function is proposed. Eight equally spaced membership functions are used in the VLSI implementation. Sim- ple voltage MIN circuits are used for rule selection. A modified Takagi-Sugeno approach with normalization and weighted sum is used in the defuzzification circuit. Weights in the defuzzifier are digitally programmable with 6-bits resolution.","[{""_id"":""53f439e7dabfaeee229cb39b"",""bio"":null,""email"":""wilam@uwyo.edu"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Bogdan M.

53e99937b7602d970217461a,"The brake subsystem is one of the most significant parts of a vehicle with respect to safety. A computer-controlled brake system has the capability of acting faster than the human driver during emergencies, and therefore has the potential of improving safety of the vehicles used in the future intelligent transportation systems (ITS's. In this paper we consider the problem of modeling and control of a computer-controlled brake system. The brake model is developed using a series of exper- iments conducted on a test bench which contains the full scale brake subsystem of a Lincoln town car and a computer-controlled actuator designed by Ford Motor Company. The developed model has the form of a first-order nonlinear system with the system nonlinearities lumped in the model coefficients. The unknown model parameters are identified by applying curve fitting tech- niques to the experimental data. The major characteristics of the system such as static friction, dead zones, and hysteresis have been identified in terms of model parameters. The brake controller design makes use of a standard feedback linearization technique along with intuitive modifications to meet the closed- loop performance specifications. The simulation results show that the proposed controller guarantees no overshoot and zero steady- state error for step inputs. Test of the same controller using the experimental bench setup demonstrates its effectiveness in meeting the performance requirements.","[{""_id"":""53f4d46adabfaef34cf8076c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Humair Raza"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f446c7dabfaee0d9bb48da"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Zhigang Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f455f0dabfaeecd69e9855"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Bingen Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5487fef6dabfae8a11fb3fdb"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Petros A.

53e99940b7602d9702180450,"Switching or blending among controllers is termed controller interpolation. This paper investigates a robust controller interpolation technique and applies it to an experimental test bed. Although an interpolated controller is composed of linear time-invariant (LTI controllers stabilizing the LTI plant, closed-loop performance and stability are not guaranteed. Thus, it is of interest to design the interpolated controller to guarantee closed-loop stability and a performance level for all interpolation signals describing controller switching sequences and combinations. The performance metric that is under investigation in this paper is the H ¿ norm. A suboptimal robust interpolated-controller design algorithm is framed in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities. The motivating example demonstrates the efficacy of the robust interpolated-controller design.","[{""_id"":""53f44bb0dabfaee1c0b02677"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Brandon Hencey"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f466f7dabfaedf4364827d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Andrew G.

The generated paths are thus guaranteed to be collision-free with respect to the moving obstacles while being executed. We present an algorithm that runs in O (n3 log n time (n being the number of obstacles for the case where the moving obstacles have the same maximum speed, and a fast implementation for the general case that is capable of planning paths amidst many growing disks within milliseconds.","[{""_id"":""53f46c7fdabfaee2a1dc731b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jur P.

Like fuzzy logic control, these methods can be analyzed by a combination of classical and qualitative methods. Each operating region of the system has a classical control law, which provides high-resolution control and can be analyzed by classical methods. Operating regions are defined by fuzzy set membership functions. The global control law is the weighted average of the local control laws, where the weights are provided by the operating region membership functions. A heterogeneous control law can be analyzed, even in the presence of incomplete knowledge, by representing it as a qualitative differential equation and using qualitative simulation to predict the set of possible behaviors of the system. By expressing the desired guarantee as a statement in a modal temporal logic, the validity of the guarantee can be automatically checked against the set of possible behaviors. We demonstrate heterogeneous controllers and our qualitative methods for proving their properties, first for a simple level controller for a water tank, and second for a highly nonlinear chemical reactor.","[{""_id"":""53f7a58cdabfae92b40d1e42"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Benjamin Kuipers"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42d2fdabfaedce54c259e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Karl Åström"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1016/0005-1098(9490027-2,"[""Differential equation"",""Control theory"",""Nonlinear system"",""Nonlinear control"",""Fuzzy set"",""Temporal logic"",""Fuzzy control system"",""Law"",""Complete information"",""Mathematics""]",,0005-1098,2,"[""Artificial intelligence"",""fuzzy control"",""qualitative simulation"",""temporal logic""]",en,150,249,233,null,"[""53e9b310b7602d9703dd7de4"",""53e9b2b1b7602d9703d579f8"",""53e9bd9fb7602d9704a4d4c1"",""53e9a797b7602d97030d4c8b"",""53e9a63eb7602d9702f6ced4"",""558ba20584ae6766fdee5cf5""]",The composition and validation of heterogeneous control laws,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0005-1098(9490027-2"",""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0005109894900272"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""539078f320f770854f5a88f4"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Automatica (Journal of IFAC"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":null}",30,1994,journal,"[""Benjamin Kuipers"",""Karl Johan Åström""]"

For robotic applications, important considerations include robustness to image defects such as intensity variation and noise, the number of false matches, and computational complexity. In the absence of ground truth data, the authors compare the matching techniques based on the percentage of matches that pass the left-right consistency test. The authors also evaluate the discriminatory power of several match validity measures that are reported in the literature for eliminating false matches and for estimating match confidence.

This principle may provide ways of understanding human beings that go beyond the current level of explanation found in the natural and social sciences. Furthermore, a methodological emphasis on humanoid robots in the design of artificial creatures holds promise because they have many degrees of freedom and sense modalities and, thus, must face the challenges of scalability that are often side-stepped in simpler domains.

 delicate balance between conflicting requirements of minimizing transfer times, minimizing the impact on the network, and
 uniformly distributing load among participants. We identify several data distribution techniques, some successfully employed
 by today’s peer-to-peer networks: staging, data partitioning, orthogonal bandwidth exploitation, and combinations of the above.
 We use simulations to explore the performance of these techniques in contexts similar to those used by today’s data-centric
 scientific collaborations and derive several recommendations for efficient data dissemination. Our experimental results show
 that the peer-to-peer solutions that offer load balancing and good fault tolerance properties and have embedded participation
 incentives lead to unjustified costs in today’s scientific data collaborations deployed on over-provisioned network cores.
 However, as user communities grow and these deployments scale, peer-to-peer data delivery mechanisms will likely outperform

A characteristic feature of the presented control method is the higher rank of the switching function caused by the application of an integral element (sliding mode with an integral function control. The proposed control system is a combination of a sliding-mode controller and a linear controller. Furthermore, to eliminate the chattering phenomenon related to the sliding-mode control, a switching function with a variable slope based on the fuzzy system is implemented. This solution ensures the robustness and dynamics of a two-mass drive better than with a linear speed controller. The main stages of the design methodology of the presented speed control structure are described in the initial sections of this paper. In the subsequent sections, simulation and experimental tests for the proposed control structure are presented and discussed.","[{""_id"":""53f43b0ddabfaeb22f49e29b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Teresa Or¿owska-Kowalska"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5433ba16dabfaebba5821097"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Marcin Kaminski"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f44e5cdabfaee0d9bd3a39"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Krzysztof Szabat"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1109/TIE.2009.2030823,"[""Control theory"",""PID controller"",""Control theory"",""Automatic control"",""Control engineering"",""Engineering"",""Control system"",""Fuzzy control system"",""Robust control"",""Variable structure control"",""Sliding mode control""]",,,4,"[""Sliding mode control"",""Fuzzy control"",""Control systems"",""Vibration control"",""Damping"",""Velocity control"",""Robust control"",""Fuzzy systems"",""Design methodology"",""Testing""]",en,98,1317,1309,null,"[""573696326e3b12023e540151"",""53e99aacb7602d970232840b"",""558af395e4b031bae1faa7d6"",""53e9b1f8b7602d9703c919dc"",""53e9996fb7602d97021b10c3"",""53e9ac05b7602d97035c5b21"",""53e99e30b7602d97026f06b0"",""53e9b3fdb7602d9703eefc70"",""558a8d8de4b0b32fcb377ff0"",""53e99c20b7602d97024ce1bd"",""53e9b017b7602d9703a71474"",""53e99f42b7602d9702813c67"",""558a95b6e4b0b32fcb37ad33"",""53e99b63b7602d970240c74f"",""558b054a84ae84d265c105fb"",""53e9ba3fb7602d970464e3e1"",""53e9bcbab7602d970493a5c4"",""53e9bce8b7602d970496c8ee"",""53e9b8a8b7602d9704480ffc""]",Implementation of a Sliding-Mode Controller With an Integral Function and Fuzzy Gain Value for the Electrical Drive With an Elastic Joint,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2030823"",""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226587"",""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5226587/""]","{""_id"":""53a72f6d20f7420be8ca7289"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",57,2010,journal,"[""Teresa Orlowska-Kowalska"",""Marcin Kaminski 0003"",""Krzysztof Szabat""]"
53e9999eb7602d97021e413a,"The main purpose of this paper is to show that overparametrization in adaptive nonlinear control is not always a bad thing and can be intentionally introduced to achieve similar performance with less control effort. To this end, an adaptive controller with partial overparametrization is first designed to solve the regulation problem of parametric-strict-feedback form nonlinear systems by combining the design procedure in Krstic et al. (System Control Lett. 19 (1992 177 with that in Kanellakopoulos et al. (IEEE Trans. Automat. Control 36 (1991 1241. Then, to reduce the control effort needed by the above controller further, a modified adaptive controller is designed by introducing a reference signal and reformulating the regulation problem as a tracking problem. The simulation results show that, compared with the adaptive controller without overparametrization, the adaptive controller with partial overparametrization can achieve similar performance with less control effort, and the modified one can do the same thing with even less control effort.","[{""_id"":""545901e7dabfaeb0fe2b7ab0"",""bio"":null,""email"":""weitian@cs.sfu.ca"",""gid"":null,""name"":""Chen Weitian"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54592003dabfaeb0fe30a9bf"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b9d7e1cd8e14a3630a6c"",""name"":""Xu Chengxian"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Research Center for Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1016/S0167-6911(0100122-0,null,,0167-6911,1,"[""Parametric-strict-feedback nonlinear systems"",""Adaptive control"",""Back-stepping""]",en,5,24,13,null,null,Adaptive nonlinear control with partial overparametrization,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-6911(0100122-0"",""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167691101001220"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":null,""issn"":""0167-6911"",""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":""North-Holland"",""raw"":""Systems & Control Letters"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":""systems-and-control-letters"",""src"":null,""t"":""J"",""type"":null}",44,2001,journal,"[""Weitian Chen"",""Chengxian Xu""]"

It is based on flyback topology operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM. The current charging into the link capacitor is controlled according to line changes by adjusting the input-current blocking angle to alleviate an excessive increase of the link voltage. The reduced voltage stress can maintain an almost-constant voltage irrespective of load conditions by operating in dc/dc stage in DCM. Experimental results of a 60-W (5-V 12-A output prototype converter show that the link voltage is limited within 384 V and that the measured power factor is more than 0.91 under universal voltage inputs and entire load conditions.

However, it is usually considered to provide poor network utilization. In this article we propose a resilience scheme based on recovery at the lowest layer in which intralayer and interlayer backup resource sharing is utilized to improve the network utilization. By applying interlayer backup resource sharing, we can totally depend on the reserved backup resources for fiber link failures to guarantee 100 percent recovery of IP router failures. In addition, by applying intralayer backup resource sharing, the network utilization improvement of recovery at the lowest layer is much more significant than at the highest layer. Simulations results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently improve network utilization and be even more capacity-efficient than resilience schemes based on recovery at the highest layer.","[{""_id"":""542a61a6dabfae61d4974e4c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869bc4e1cd8e14a3972e03"",""name"":""Lei Lei"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2881c455f439fe3c85d"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45962dabfaee0d9bff7d4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Aibo Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54593ad5dabfaeb0fe351a31"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yuefeng Ji"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1109/MCOM.2004.1262165,"[""Survivability"",""Telecommunications network"",""Computer science"",""Computer network"",""Network architecture"",""Shared resource"",""IP forwarding"",""Overlay network"",""Backup"",""Scalability"",""Distributed computing""]",,0163-6804,1,"[""fiber link failures"",""joint resilience scheme"",""ip networks"",""resilience scheme"",""wdm networks"",""network traffic"",""highest layer"",""interlayer backup resource sharing"",""wavelength division multiplexing"",""optical fibre networks"",""telecommunication network reliability"",""network utilization improvement"",""lowest layer"",""network utilization"",""percent recovery"",""dynamic traffic demand"",""ip router failures"",""internet"",""intralayer backup resource sharing"",""telecommunication traffic"",""telecommunication network routing"",""internet protocol"",""wdm network"",""poor network utilization"",""routing"",""resilience"",""intelligent networks"",""resource management"",""network topology"",""resource sharing""]",en,37,84,78,null,"[""53e9a366b7602d9702c7006c"",""53e99bcdb7602d97024777ee"",""53e99afeb7602d970238e9b8"",""53e9bd4bb7602d97049dd5e9""]",A joint resilience scheme with interlayer backup resource sharing in IP over WDM networks,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2004.1262165"",""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1262165"",""https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2004.1262165"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""5390a75a20f70186a0e8db68"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IEEE Communications Magazine"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":11}",42,2004,journal,"[""Lei Lei 0004"",""Aibo Liu"",""Yuefeng Ji""]"

53e999e7b7602d970222c525,"Collision detection and avoidance are important in robotics. Compared with commonly used circular disks, elliptic disks provide a more compact shape representation for robots or other vehicles confined to move in the plane. Furthermore, elliptic disks allow a simpler analytic representation than rectangular boxes, which makes it easier to perform continuous collision detection (CCD. We shall present a fast and accurate method for CCD between two moving elliptic disks, which avoids any need to sample the time domain of the motion, thus avoiding the possibility of missing collisions between time samples. Based on some new algebraic conditions on the separation of two ellipses, we reduce collision detection for two moving ellipses to the problem of detecting real roots of a univariate equation, which is the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of the two ellipses.

53e99a6db7602d97022da316,"Two methods of mosaicking images were developed, one for the simple case of a shift between two following images and another one for the general case. For the simple mosaicking, the error rate is acceptable for both cases of noisy or less noisy images. Owing to the fact that future generations of scouts would be provided with the 2.4 GHz transmission frequency, panoramic mosaics can be created with a high level of success. The operation is completely automated, and the execution time is close to three minutes for each mosaic. For the case of mosaicking images in general, the major problem is that the quality of the images given by the scout does not allow for choosing a small number of points for the Harris detector. This leads to long execution times. Furthermore, it is extremely hard to realize a panoramic vision by such a method because it is still unreliable without the intervention of an operator. Building 360° mosaics is not practical. Nevertheless, the general method can be used for creating precise mosaics of three consecutive images, thus providing wide-angle images. Image resulting from this operation represents 100° mosaics. Alas, the time of calculation is still a considerable four minutes.","[{""_id"":""53f44fd9dabfaefedbb383cf"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Christian C.

53e99a98b7602d9702311545,This article has presented a tightly integrated systems architecture for a decentralized CSAT mission management algorithm and demonstrated successful implementation in actual hardware flight tests. This CSAT architecture allows each UAV to accomplish a combined search and track mission by conceptualizing the searching aspect as a spare time strategy to be executed optimally over a short time horizon when the agents are not actively tracking a vehicle. This presented a balance between the two conflicting search and track modes and allowed the mission to achieve more than simply searching or tracking alone.,"[{""_id"":""548629b0dabfae8a11fb3033"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c91c3"",""name"":""jonathan p how"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""stanford university"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2841c455f439fe3c67b"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f433dfdabfaec22ba68906"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""clive s fraser"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4380edabfaec22ba90cae"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""k c kulling"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43ac9dabfaedce55598ce"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""luca f bertuccelli"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43a94dabfaee4dc7aa4e1"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""olivier toupet"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2040388519""},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""l brunet"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2718756791""},{""_id"":""53f44946dabfaec09f1d48e0"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""abraham bachrach"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2162591059""},{""_id"":""53f581c8dabfaea878f8045b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""nicholas roy"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""2103369886""},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1109/MRA.2009.932530,"[""Remotely operated underwater vehicle"",""Architecture"",""Decentralised system"",""Time horizon"",""Autonomy"",""Automation"",""Real-time computing"",""Control engineering"",""Vehicle dynamics"",""Integrated systems"",""Engineering""]",,,2,"[""Target tracking"",""Unmanned aerial vehicles"",""Vehicle dynamics"",""Uncertainty"",""Intelligent vehicles"",""Vehicle detection"",""Remotely operated vehicles"",""Bandwidth"",""Collaboration"",""Surveillance""]",en,104,51,43,null,"[""53e99ab2b7602d970232cc1a"",""573696816e3b12023e58cd19"",""53e9affab7602d9703a50898"",""53e9a8d3b7602d9703220a25"",""53e9b1a9b7602d9703c33f0c"",""558aaeda84ae84d265bf0b45"",""53e9a439b7602d9702d5575a"",""53e9bcc1b7602d9704944bbd"",""53e9ac22b7602d97035e5fef"",""53e9bd6ab7602d9704a08589"",""53e9a627b7602d9702f54f51""]",Increasing autonomy of UAVs,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2009.932530"",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5069835/""]","{""_id"":""555036c87cea80f954155dcc"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IEEE Robot.

The IPsec protocols, however, do not address the policies for how protected traffic should be handled at security end points. This article introduces an efficient policy management scheme for IPsec, based on the principles of trust management. A compliance check is added to the IPsec architecture that tests packet filters proposed when new security associations are created for conformance with the local security policy, based on credentials presented by the peer host. Security policies and credentials can be quite sophisticated (and specified in the trust-management language, while still allowing very efficient packet-filtering for the actual IPsec traffic. We present a practical portable implementation of this design, based on the KeyNote trust-management language, that works with a variety of UNIX-based IPsec implementations. Finally, we discuss some applications of the enhanced IPsec architecture.","[{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""0""},{""_id"":""53f437dddabfaedce553cb48"",""bio"":null,""email"":""jig@research.att.com"",""gid"":null,""name"":""JOHN IOANNIDIS"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":""10490398""},{""_id"":""53f4ab34dabfaeb22f575ac2"",""bio"":null,""email"":""angelos@cs.columbia.edu"",""gid"":null,""name"":""ANGELOS D.

53e99afdb7602d970238a102,"Entity resolution is the problem of reconciling database references corresponding to the same real-world entities. Given the abundance of publicly available databases that have unresolved entities, we motivate the problem of query-time entity resolution: quick and accurate resolution for answering queries over such 'unclean' databases at query-time. Since collective entity resolution approaches — where related references are resolved jointly — have been shown to be more accurate than independent attribute-based resolution for off-line entity resolution, we focus on developing new algorithms for collective resolution for answering entity resolution queries at query-time. For this purpose, we first formally show that, for collective resolution, precision and recall for individual entities follow a geometric progression as neighbors at increasing distances are considered. Unfolding this progression leads naturally to a two stage 'expand and resolve' query processing strategy. In this strategy, we first extract the related records for a query using two novel expansion operators, and then resolve the extracted records collectively. We then show how the same strategy can be adapted for query-time entity resolution by identifying and resolving only those database references that are the most helpful for processing the query. We validate our approach on two large real-world publication databases where we show the usefulness of collective resolution and at the same time demonstrate the need for adaptive strategies for query processing. We then show how the same queries can be answered in real-time using our adaptive approach while preserving the gains of collective resolution. In addition to experiments on real datasets, we use synthetically generated data to empirically demonstrate the validity of the performance trends predicted by our analysis of collective entity resolution over a wide range of structural characteristics in the data.","[{""_id"":""53f44576dabfaee02ad151cf"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c99b5"",""name"":""Indrajit Bhattacharya"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""University of Maryland, College Park, MD"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b56b1c455f439fe510de"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f47032dabfaeb2ac11beb6"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6c0e1cd8e14a34c99b5"",""name"":""Lise Getoor"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""University of Maryland, College Park, MD"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b56b1c455f439fe510de"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45c4bdabfaedf43620eff"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1145/1150402.1150463,"[""Data mining"",""Name resolution"",""Adaptive strategies"",""Information retrieval"",""Computer science"",""Precision and recall"",""Geometric progression"",""Operator (computer programming""]",1-59593-339-5,"Journal Of Artificial Intelligence Research, Volume 30, pages

This paper reports on an on-going research and development effort in remote surface inspection of space platforms such as the Space Station Freedom. It describes the space environment and identifies the types of damage for which to search. The paper provides an overview of the Remote Surface Inspection System that has been developed at JPL to conduct proof-of-concept demonstrations and to perform experiments in a laboratory environment. Specifically, the paper describes three technology areas: (1 manipulator control for sensor placement, (2 automated non-contact inspection to detect and classify flaws, and (3 operator interface to command the system interactively and receive raw or processed sensor data. Initial findings for the automated and human visual inspection tests are reported.","[{""_id"":""54323a4bdabfaeb54214a9e7"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86c40ee1cd8e14a3ac6331"",""name"":""samad hayati"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""jet propulsion laboratory"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2831c455f439fe3c618"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43926dabfaeecd697947f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86c40ee1cd8e14a3ac6331"",""name"":""j balaram"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""jet propulsion laboratory"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2831c455f439fe3c618"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5448e9a4dabfae87b7e9302c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86c40ee1cd8e14a3ac6331"",""name"":""homayoun seraji"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""jet propulsion laboratory"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2831c455f439fe3c618"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5406de73dabfae8faa627b75"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86c40ee1cd8e14a3ac6331"",""name"":""woo sik kim"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""jet propulsion laboratory"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2831c455f439fe3c618"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f435a9dabfaee43ec29c9f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""kam tso"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""v c prasad"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":null,""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":null,""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1016/0921-8890(9390007-Y,"[""Visual inspection"",""Automated X-ray inspection"",""Space environment"",""Computer science"",""Real-time computing"",""Space Station Freedom"",""Autonomous system (Internet"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Robotics"",""Automated optical inspection"",""Remote operation"",""Computer vision"",""Remote control"",""Space technology"",""Engineering"",""User interface"",""Telerobotics""]",,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,1,"[""Robotics"",""Telerobotics"",""Inspection"",""SSF""]",en,22,882vol.3,875,//static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/001/049/624/remote_surface_inspection_system.pdf,"[""557cdf646feeaa8086da2eca"",""557d42756feeaa8086da8df4""]",Remote surface inspection system,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0921-8890(9390007-Y"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1993.292254"",""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092188909390007Y"",""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractAuthors.jsp?tp=&arnumber=292254""]","{""_id"":""53909e7b20f70186a0e2a2e8"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Robotics and Autonomous Systems"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",11,1993,journal,"[""Samad Hayati"",""J.
