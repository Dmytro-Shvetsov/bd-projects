Arindam Banerjee,53e997e8b7602d9701fe0337,"Cluster ensembles provide a framework for combining multiple base clusterings of a dataset to generate a stable and robust consensus clustering. There are important variants of the basic cluster ensemble problem, notably including cluster ensembles with missing values, row- or column-distributed cluster ensembles. Existing cluster ensemble algorithms are applicable only to a small subset of these variants. In this paper, we propose Bayesian cluster ensemble (BCE, which is a mixed-membership model for learning cluster ensembles, and is applicable to all the primary variants of the problem. We propose a variational approximation based algorithm for learning Bayesian cluster ensembles. BCE is further generalized to deal with the case where the features of original data points are available, referred to as generalized BCE (GBCE. We compare BCE extensively with several other cluster ensemble algorithms, and demonstrate that BCE is not only versatile in terms of its applicability but also outperforms other algorithms in terms of stability and accuracy. Moreover, GBCE can have higher accuracy than BCE, especially with only a small number of available base clusterings. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Caiyun Chen,53e997ddb7602d9701fd32c9,"A novel sparse measure of signal is proposed and the efficient number of sources is estimated by the best confidence limit
 in this work. The observations are classified by SVM trained through samples which are constructed by direction angle of sources.
 And columns of the mixing matrix corresponding to clustering centers of each class are obtained based on the sum of samples
 belong to the same class with different weights which are adjusted adaptively. It gets out of the trap of the initial values
 which interfere k-mean clustering quite a lot. Furthermore, the online algorithm for estimating basis matrix is proposed for
 large scale samples. The shortest path method is used to recover the source signals after estimating the mixing matrix. The
 favorable simulations show the stability and robustness of the algorithms.

Chao Sun,53e997e3b7602d9701fd9dee,"Land use/land cover change (LUCC caused by human beings is the main source of the increases of CO2 in the atmosphere. Land resource is not only the natural carrier of carbon emission of land ecosystems, but also the spatial carrier of carbon emission from human society. Human activity and its carbon emission intension have a very close relationship with the land use pattern, exploration on the low-carbon oriented land use scope, and land use structure can effectively reduce the rate of carbon emission, and also provides consults to low-carbon oriented land use planning. This paper presents a multi-objective land use optimization model based on low-carbon development. Carbon emission, economic benefit objectives, and constraint conditions are integrated into the multi-objectives optimization model of land use, and the model was solved with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II. And through providing weight coefficients to the objective functions, land use patterns in three scenarios (low-carbon, mid-carbon, high-carbon were obtained. © 2013 IEEE.","[{""_id"":""53f430e5dabfaedf4354318b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wenlong Jing"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42c98dabfaedd74d2b26e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Heli Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""543332eddabfaeb43f2a6d38"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaochen Qin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5601a67845cedb3395e86931"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Chao Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""544866f0dabfae87b7e1ab61"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lin Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""56cb1898c35f4f3c65653a17"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jincai Zhao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1109/Geoinformatics.2013.6626051,"[""Land information system"",""Hydrology"",""Sorting"",""Environmental science"",""Air pollution"",""Land cover"",""Genetic algorithm"",""Carbon"",""Land use"",""Land-use planning"",""Agricultural engineering""]",,21610258,null,"[""land use optimization"",""low-carbon development"",""nsga-ii"",""optimization"",""sociology"",""carbon dioxide"",""economics"",""air pollution"",""linear programming"",""ecology"",""statistics"",""genetic algorithms""]",en,1,5,1,null,"[""53e9b010b7602d9703a65a43""]",Multi-objective land use optimization based on low-carbon development using NSGA-II.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Geoinformatics.2013.6626051""]","{""_id"":""5550370f7cea80f9541711fe"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Conference on Geoinformatics"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Geoinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",null,2013,International Conference on Geoinformatics,ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS),"{""_id"":""5601a67845cedb3395e86931"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Chao Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[1],1

Compared with Epidemic, Spray And Wait Spray, And Focus and Encounter-based routing, our proposed algorithm is the only one that achieves comparable performance under both Helsinki City Scenario and Cambridge-iMote Scenario. ? 2014 Lei You et al.","[{""_id"":""53f42c7fdabfaee1c0a2603d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lei You"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542c2053dabfae2b4e1e2d65"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jianbo Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f3a02edabfae4b34ab518e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Changjiang Wei"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f438bcdabfaeb1a7c09f15"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Chenqu Dai"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f44f8ddabfaee2a1d58fed"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jixing Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1155/2014/742047,"[""Link-state routing protocol"",""Dynamic Source Routing"",""Computer science"",""Static routing"",""Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector routing"",""Computer network"",""Wireless Routing Protocol"",""Ad hoc wireless distribution service"",""Adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing"",""Optimized Link State Routing Protocol"",""Distributed computing""]",,15501477,null,[],en,2,null,null,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997ddb7602d9701fd31c1_0.pdf,"[""53e9a2dcb7602d9702be6dae"",""53e9abf1b7602d97035b1a59"",""53e9b2b8b7602d9703d60e5a"",""53e9b27bb7602d9703d203b9"",""53e99cfdb7602d97025b4823"",""53e9b833b7602d97043edafa"",""53e9b5b6b7602d97040fefb2"",""53e9b281b7602d9703d2b537"",""53e999e0b7602d9702225fc4"",""558af1cce4b031bae1fa9d61"",""53e99f42b7602d9702814fad"",""53e9b4cab7602d9703fe9304"",""53e9a6edb7602d9703022fbe"",""599c7c62601a182cd27a868d"",""5550423445ce0a409eb408ea"",""53e99c84b7602d970253697a"",""53e9a108b7602d97029f6552""]",A General and Specific Utility-Based Adaptive Routing for Delay Tolerant Networks.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/742047"",""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1155/2014/742047""]","{""_id"":""53a731d520f7420be8d651d2"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IJDSN"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",2014,2014,International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks,International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks,"{""_id"":""53f438bcdabfaeb1a7c09f15"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Chenqu Dai"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[2],1
Chuanxiong Guo,53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b,"A fundamental challenge in data center networking is how to efficiently interconnect an exponentially increasing number of servers. This paper presents DCell, a novel network structure that has many desirable features for data center networking. DCell is a recursively defined structure, in which a high-level DCell is constructed from many low-level DCells and DCells at the same level are fully connected with one another. DCell scales doubly exponentially as the node degree increases. DCell is fault tolerant since it does not have single point of failure and its distributed fault-tolerant routing protocol performs near shortest-path routing even in the presence of severe link or node failures. DCell also provides higher network capacity than the traditional tree-based structure for various types of services. Furthermore, DCell can be incrementally expanded and a partial DCell provides the same appealing features. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that DCell is a viable interconnection structure for data centers.","[{""_id"":""53f7a457dabfae9060ad6dfd"",""bio"":null,""email"":""chguo@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Chuanxiong Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a50f5dabfae61d4969d02"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hwu@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Haitao Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54084fdedabfae44f087b22e"",""bio"":null,""email"":""kuntan@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Kun Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f5634adabfae5e5bf80463"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Lei Shi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4630fdabfaeb22f52f212"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ygz@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Yongguang Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4792fdabfaec09f2882e2"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zslu@cs.ucla.edu"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Songwu Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1145/1402946.1402968,"[""Single point of failure"",""Data center network architectures"",""Computer science"",""Server"",""Computer network"",""Network topology"",""Bisection bandwidth"",""Fault tolerance"",""Distributed computing"",""Routing protocol"",""Scalability""]",,01464833,4,"[""data center"",""network topology"",""throughput"",""fault tolerance""]",en,1143,86,75,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b_0.pdf,"[""53e99d4bb7602d9702602ec7"",""53e99adcb7602d9702360f1e"",""53e9ac2eb7602d97035f4104"",""599c7f2d601a182cd28f68d5"",""53e9ab69b7602d970350990d"",""557cf1336feeaa8086da40ad"",""53e99b78b7602d970241f5f5"",""53e99cfdb7602d97025b2103"",""55827efb0cf2bf7bae57aa4e"",""53e9bb52b7602d9704790954""]",Dcell: a scalable and fault-tolerant network structure for data centers,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402946.1402968"",""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555037717cea80f9541880b1"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""ACM SIGCOMM Conference (SIGCOMM)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SIGCOMM"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",38,2008,SIGCOMM,ACM SIGCOMM Conference (SIGCOMM),"{""_id"":""53f7a457dabfae9060ad6dfd"",""bio"":null,""email"":""chguo@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Chuanxiong Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[1143],1

David Zhang,53e997f1b7602d9701ff1f66,"Traditional cryptosystems are based on passwords, which can be cracked (simple ones or forgotten (complex ones. This paper
 proposes a novel cryptosystem based on palmprints. This system directly uses the palmprint as a key to encrypt/decrypt information.
 The information of a palmprint is so complex that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to crack the system while it need
 not remember anything to use the system. In the encrypting phase, a 1024 bits binary string is extracted from the palmprints
 using differential operations. Then the string is translated to a 128 bits encrypting key using a Hash function, and at the
 same time, an error-correct-code (ECC is generated. Some general encryption algorithms use the 128 bits encrypting key to
 encrypt the secret information. In decrypting phase, the 1024 bits binary string extracted from the input palmprint is first
 corrected using the ECC. Then the corrected string is translated to a decrypting key using the same Hash function. Finally,
 the corresponding general decryption algorithms use decrypting key to decrypt the information. The experimental results show
 that the accuracy and security of this system can meet the requirement of most applications.

Dieter Schmidt,53e997ccb7602d9701fbe567,"In this paper, we try to clarify some of the questions related to a key concept in multivariate polynomial solving algorithm over a finite field: the degree of regularity. By the degree of regularity, here we refer to a concept first presented by Dubois and Gama, namely the lowest degree at which certain nontrivial degree drop of a polynomial systemoccurs. Currently, it is somehow commonly accepted that we can use this degree to estimate the complexity of solving a polynomial system, even though we do not have systematic empirical data or a theory to support such a claim. In this paper, we would like to clarify the situation with the help of experiments. We first define a concept of solving degree for a polynomial system. The key question we then need to clarify is the connection of solving degree and the degree of regularity with focus on quadratic systems. To exclude the cases that do not represent the general situation, we need to define when a system is degenerate and when it is irreducible. With extensive computer experiments, we show that the two concepts, the degree of regularity and the solving degree, are related for irreducible systems in the sense that the difference between the two degrees is indeed small, less than 3. But due to the limitation of our experiments, we speculate that this may not be the case for high degree cases. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","[{""_id"":""53f42f32dabfaeb2ac0010b1"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jintai Ding"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45e10dabfaedf43626eb2"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Dieter Schmidt"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-42001-6_4,"[""Finite field"",""Polynomial"",""Square-free polynomial"",""Quadratic equation"",""Pure mathematics"",""Degree of a polynomial"",""Homogeneous polynomial"",""Reciprocal polynomial"",""Matrix polynomial"",""Mathematics""]",,16113349,null,"[""degree of regularity"",""hfe"",""hfev"",""non-degenerate system"",""random polynomial system"",""solving degree""]",en,6,49,34,null,"[""53e99d04b7602d97025b9537"",""53e9bce8b7602d970496b265"",""53e9b1aab7602d9703c389d6"",""53e9b790b7602d9704338bde"",""53e9a85cb7602d97031a4789"",""53e9b241b7602d9703ce1d75"",""53e99f28b7602d97027f7ca6"",""53e9b295b7602d9703d3d5da"",""53e9b77db7602d9704322d57"",""53e9b716b7602d97042b00f4"",""53e9b740b7602d97042d8511"",""53e9ba32b7602d970463fd28"",""53e9abaab7602d9703556038"",""53e9a010b7602d97028f126a""]",Solving Degree and Degree of Regularity for Polynomial Systems over a Finite Fields.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-42001-6_4""]","{""_id"":""5390799820f770854f5c0fb4"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Number theory and cryptography"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",8260 LNCS,2013,Number Theory and Cryptography,null,"{""_id"":""53f45e10dabfaedf43626eb2"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Dieter Schmidt"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[6],1

 The aim of duplicate detection is to group records in a relation which refer to the same entity in the real world such as
 a person or business. Most existing works require user specified parameters such as similarity threshold in order to conduct
 duplicate detection. These methods are called user-first in this paper. However, in many scenarios, pre-specification from
 the user is very hard and often unreliable, thus limiting applicability of user-first methods. In this paper, we propose a
 user-last method, called Active Duplicate Detection (ADD, where an initial solution is returned without forcing user to specify such parameters and then user is involved to refine
 the initial solution. Different from user-first methods where user makes decision before any processing, ADD allows user to
 make decision based on an initial solution. The identified initial solution in ADD enjoys comparatively high quality and is
 easy to be refined in a systematic way (at almost zero cost.

 We describe a method for objective and quantitative evaluation of image quality. The method represents a novel use of image
 enhancement concepts. It employs three new measures that evaluate the definition of contours, uniform intensity distribution,
 and noise rate in determining the image quality. Because the three measures have clear physical meanings, they can be selectively
 applied according to the viewer’s evaluation criteria. The three measures are relatively inexpensive to compute, making them
 suitable for automated ranking of image quality in personal digital imaging devices, such as digital cameras. However, the
 method is equally adept at evaluating other digital images such as those on the Internet. Experiments with the method show
 good correlation with visual quality assessment for various image subject types.

Guizhong Liu,53e997ccb7602d9701fbe663,"Compared with other existing video coding standards, H.264/AVC can achieve a significant improvement in compression performances.
 A robust criterion named the rate distortion optimization (RDO is employed to select the optimal coding modes and motion
 vectors for each macroblock (MB, which achieves a high compression ratio while leading to a great increase in the complexity
 and computational load unfortunately. In this paper, a fast mode decision algorithm for H.264/AVC intra prediction based on
 integer transform and adaptive threshold is proposed. Before the intra prediction, integer transform operations on the original
 image are executed to find the directions of local textures. According to this direction, only a small part of the possible
 intra prediction modes are tested for RDO calculation at the first step. If the minimum mean absolute error (MMAE of the
 reconstructed block corresponding to the best mode is smaller than an adaptive threshold which depends on the quantization

 aims to balance the compression performance and the computational load. Simulation results with various video sequences show
 that the fast mode decision algorithm proposed in this paper can accelerate the encoding speed significantly only with negligible

 An algorithm for alternate pattern fill on arbitrary line segments, circular arcs and elliptical arcs is proposed in this
 paper. The algorithm creates an external loop which is a minimal loop that contains a given point. And then, all loops that
 delimit the nested regions for the alternate pattern fill inside the external loop are built. The loop detection is based
 on a new method for searching the leftmost edges. It requires only values of positions, tangent vectors, curvature radii,
 and the first derivatives of curvature radii at intersection points and areas of circles and ellipses. After all necessary
 loops are built, the given pattern is filled in the nested loops inside the external loop. Filling the given pattern in this
 paper is simplified into filling line segment patterns on some parallel lines.

Guoyu Tang,53e997ccb7602d9701fbf933,"Observation on query log of search engine indicates that queries are usually ambiguous. Similar to document ranking, search intents should be ranked to facilitate information search. Previous work attempts to rank intents with merely relevance score. We argue that diversity is also important. In this work, unified models are proposed to rank intents underlying a query by combining relevance score and diversity degree, in which the latter is reflected by non-overlapping ratio of every intent and aggregated non-overlapping ratio of a set of intents. Three conclusions are drawn according to the experiment results. Firstly, diversity plays an important role in intent ranking. Secondly, URL is more effective than similarity in detecting unique subtopics. Thirdly, the aggregated non-overlapping ratio makes some contribution in similarity based intent ranking but little in URL based intent ranking. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[{""_id"":""53f4542edabfaec09f1fe41d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yunqing Xia"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f433c2dabfaee0d9b4b7a9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaoshi Zhong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f437b5dabfaee1c0aa9512"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guoyu Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5409580ddabfae450f47981d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Junjun Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a4637dabfae646d547b98"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiang Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa115adabfae7f97b04ca8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Thomas Fang Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f456abdabfaedd74e2f16a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qinan Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43325dabfaee43ec0e0ed"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Sen Na"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4d485dabfaeedd0782335"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaohai Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23,"[""Search engine"",""Query log"",""Information retrieval"",""Ranking"",""Computer science"",""Ranking (information retrieval""]",,16113349,null,"[""aggregated non-overlapping ratio"",""diversity"",""intent ranking"",""non-overlapping ratio"",""relevance""]",en,2,271,266,null,"[""53e9b180b7602d9703c068bd"",""573697446e3b12023e6319c1"",""573697446e3b12023e631ab0"",""573697446e3b12023e631cdc"",""573697446e3b12023e631a50"",""53e99a14b7602d970226763d"",""573697446e3b12023e631aa1"",""53e9b50bb7602d97040406b8""]",Ranking Search Intents Underlying a Query.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23""]","{""_id"":""5550379f7cea80f954193043"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""NLDB"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7934 LNCS,2013,Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases,International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases (NLDB),"{""_id"":""53f437b5dabfaee1c0aa9512"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guoyu Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[2],1

 Knowledge representation and inference is a key issue of Knowledge Grid. This paper proposes Knowledge Map (KM model for
 representing and reasoning causal knowledge as an overlay in Knowledge Grid. It extends Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM to represent
 and infer not only cause-effect causal relations, but also time-delay causal relations, conditional probabilistic causal relations
 and sequential relations. Mathematical model and inference rules of KM are presented. Simulations show that KM is more powerful

Haitao Wu,53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b,"A fundamental challenge in data center networking is how to efficiently interconnect an exponentially increasing number of servers. This paper presents DCell, a novel network structure that has many desirable features for data center networking. DCell is a recursively defined structure, in which a high-level DCell is constructed from many low-level DCells and DCells at the same level are fully connected with one another. DCell scales doubly exponentially as the node degree increases. DCell is fault tolerant since it does not have single point of failure and its distributed fault-tolerant routing protocol performs near shortest-path routing even in the presence of severe link or node failures. DCell also provides higher network capacity than the traditional tree-based structure for various types of services. Furthermore, DCell can be incrementally expanded and a partial DCell provides the same appealing features. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that DCell is a viable interconnection structure for data centers.","[{""_id"":""53f7a457dabfae9060ad6dfd"",""bio"":null,""email"":""chguo@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Chuanxiong Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a50f5dabfae61d4969d02"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hwu@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Haitao Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54084fdedabfae44f087b22e"",""bio"":null,""email"":""kuntan@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Kun Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f5634adabfae5e5bf80463"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Lei Shi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4630fdabfaeb22f52f212"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ygz@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Yongguang Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4792fdabfaec09f2882e2"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zslu@cs.ucla.edu"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Songwu Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1145/1402946.1402968,"[""Single point of failure"",""Data center network architectures"",""Computer science"",""Server"",""Computer network"",""Network topology"",""Bisection bandwidth"",""Fault tolerance"",""Distributed computing"",""Routing protocol"",""Scalability""]",,01464833,4,"[""data center"",""network topology"",""throughput"",""fault tolerance""]",en,1143,86,75,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b_0.pdf,"[""53e99d4bb7602d9702602ec7"",""53e99adcb7602d9702360f1e"",""53e9ac2eb7602d97035f4104"",""599c7f2d601a182cd28f68d5"",""53e9ab69b7602d970350990d"",""557cf1336feeaa8086da40ad"",""53e99b78b7602d970241f5f5"",""53e99cfdb7602d97025b2103"",""55827efb0cf2bf7bae57aa4e"",""53e9bb52b7602d9704790954""]",Dcell: a scalable and fault-tolerant network structure for data centers,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402946.1402968"",""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555037717cea80f9541880b1"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""ACM SIGCOMM Conference (SIGCOMM)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SIGCOMM"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",38,2008,SIGCOMM,ACM SIGCOMM Conference (SIGCOMM),"{""_id"":""542a50f5dabfae61d4969d02"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hwu@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Haitao Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[1143],1
Hanhuai Shan,53e997e8b7602d9701fe0337,"Cluster ensembles provide a framework for combining multiple base clusterings of a dataset to generate a stable and robust consensus clustering. There are important variants of the basic cluster ensemble problem, notably including cluster ensembles with missing values, row- or column-distributed cluster ensembles. Existing cluster ensemble algorithms are applicable only to a small subset of these variants. In this paper, we propose Bayesian cluster ensemble (BCE, which is a mixed-membership model for learning cluster ensembles, and is applicable to all the primary variants of the problem. We propose a variational approximation based algorithm for learning Bayesian cluster ensembles. BCE is further generalized to deal with the case where the features of original data points are available, referred to as generalized BCE (GBCE. We compare BCE extensively with several other cluster ensemble algorithms, and demonstrate that BCE is not only versatile in terms of its applicability but also outperforms other algorithms in terms of stability and accuracy. Moreover, GBCE can have higher accuracy than BCE, especially with only a small number of available base clusterings. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Heli Lu,53e997e3b7602d9701fd9dee,"Land use/land cover change (LUCC caused by human beings is the main source of the increases of CO2 in the atmosphere. Land resource is not only the natural carrier of carbon emission of land ecosystems, but also the spatial carrier of carbon emission from human society. Human activity and its carbon emission intension have a very close relationship with the land use pattern, exploration on the low-carbon oriented land use scope, and land use structure can effectively reduce the rate of carbon emission, and also provides consults to low-carbon oriented land use planning. This paper presents a multi-objective land use optimization model based on low-carbon development. Carbon emission, economic benefit objectives, and constraint conditions are integrated into the multi-objectives optimization model of land use, and the model was solved with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II. And through providing weight coefficients to the objective functions, land use patterns in three scenarios (low-carbon, mid-carbon, high-carbon were obtained. © 2013 IEEE.","[{""_id"":""53f430e5dabfaedf4354318b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wenlong Jing"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42c98dabfaedd74d2b26e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Heli Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""543332eddabfaeb43f2a6d38"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaochen Qin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5601a67845cedb3395e86931"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Chao Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""544866f0dabfae87b7e1ab61"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lin Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""56cb1898c35f4f3c65653a17"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jincai Zhao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1109/Geoinformatics.2013.6626051,"[""Land information system"",""Hydrology"",""Sorting"",""Environmental science"",""Air pollution"",""Land cover"",""Genetic algorithm"",""Carbon"",""Land use"",""Land-use planning"",""Agricultural engineering""]",,21610258,null,"[""land use optimization"",""low-carbon development"",""nsga-ii"",""optimization"",""sociology"",""carbon dioxide"",""economics"",""air pollution"",""linear programming"",""ecology"",""statistics"",""genetic algorithms""]",en,1,5,1,null,"[""53e9b010b7602d9703a65a43""]",Multi-objective land use optimization based on low-carbon development using NSGA-II.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Geoinformatics.2013.6626051""]","{""_id"":""5550370f7cea80f9541711fe"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Conference on Geoinformatics"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Geoinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",null,2013,International Conference on Geoinformatics,ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS),"{""_id"":""53f42c98dabfaedd74d2b26e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Heli Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[1],1
Heung-yeung Shum,53e9979fb7602d9701f71557,"In this paper, we introduce background cut, a high quality and real- time foreground layer extraction algorithm. From a single video sequence with a moving foreground object and stationary background, our algorithm combines background subtraction, color and contrast cues to extract a foreground layer accurately and efficiently. The key idea in background cut is background con- trast attenuation, which adaptively attenuates the contrasts in the background while preserving the contrasts across foreground/background boundaries. Our algorithm builds upon a key observation that the contrast (or more precisely, color image gradient in the background is dissimilar to the contrast across fore- ground/background boundaries in most cases. Using background cut, the layer extraction errorscaused by background cluttercan be substantially reduced. More- over, we present an adaptive mixture model of global and per-pixel background colors toimprove the robustnessofour systemundervarious background changes. Experimental results of high quality composite video demonstrate the effective- ness of our background cut algorithm.","[{""_id"":""53f43097dabfaedf4353f3bc"",""bio"":null,""email"":""jiansun@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b86b6c4e1cd8e14a34cbabc"",""name"":""Jian Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":""544bd93845ce266baea82e9d"",""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, P.R.

Hongjun Wang,53e997e8b7602d9701fe0337,"Cluster ensembles provide a framework for combining multiple base clusterings of a dataset to generate a stable and robust consensus clustering. There are important variants of the basic cluster ensemble problem, notably including cluster ensembles with missing values, row- or column-distributed cluster ensembles. Existing cluster ensemble algorithms are applicable only to a small subset of these variants. In this paper, we propose Bayesian cluster ensemble (BCE, which is a mixed-membership model for learning cluster ensembles, and is applicable to all the primary variants of the problem. We propose a variational approximation based algorithm for learning Bayesian cluster ensembles. BCE is further generalized to deal with the case where the features of original data points are available, referred to as generalized BCE (GBCE. We compare BCE extensively with several other cluster ensemble algorithms, and demonstrate that BCE is not only versatile in terms of its applicability but also outperforms other algorithms in terms of stability and accuracy. Moreover, GBCE can have higher accuracy than BCE, especially with only a small number of available base clusterings. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

 We describe a method for objective and quantitative evaluation of image quality. The method represents a novel use of image
 enhancement concepts. It employs three new measures that evaluate the definition of contours, uniform intensity distribution,
 and noise rate in determining the image quality. Because the three measures have clear physical meanings, they can be selectively
 applied according to the viewer’s evaluation criteria. The three measures are relatively inexpensive to compute, making them
 suitable for automated ranking of image quality in personal digital imaging devices, such as digital cameras. However, the
 method is equally adept at evaluating other digital images such as those on the Internet. Experiments with the method show
 good correlation with visual quality assessment for various image subject types.

Huifang Deng,53e997d1b7602d9701fc2ee0,"Various instance weighting methods have been proposed for instance-based transfer learning. Kernel Mean Matching (KMM is one of the typical instance weighting approaches which estimates the instance importance by matching the two distributions in the universal reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS. However, KMM is an unsupervised learning approach which does not utilize the class label knowledge of the source data. In this paper, we extended KMM by leveraging the class label knowledge and integrated KMM and SVM into an unified optimization framework called KMM-LM (Large Margin. The objective of KMM-LM is to maximize the geometric soft margin, and minimize the empirical classification error together with the domain discrepancy based on KMM simultaneously. KMM-LM utilizes an iterative minimization algorithm to find the optimal weight vector of the classification decision hyperplane and the importance weight vector of the instances in the source domain. The experiments show that KMM-LM outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","[{""_id"":""542a8334dabfae646d56c24a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qi Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43be1dabfaee4dc7b61ff"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Huifang Deng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46961dabfaedf43651dd4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Pei Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35527-1_19,"[""Kernel (linear algebra"",""Weighting"",""Pattern recognition"",""Source data"",""Computer science"",""Support vector machine"",""Unsupervised learning"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Hyperplane"",""Variable kernel density estimation"",""Reproducing kernel Hilbert space""]",,16113349,null,"[""instance weighting"",""kernel mean matching"",""large margin"",""transfer learning""]",en,6,234,223,null,"[""53e9a965b7602d97032bc8a8"",""53e99d1ab7602d97025ce3c8"",""53e99f69b7602d970283b36f"",""53e9997eb7602d97021bdc19"",""53e9a3abb7602d9702cb8866"",""53e99bdcb7602d970248324c"",""53e99a0eb7602d970225d18a"",""53e9ab6fb7602d970350dc5d"",""53e9b281b7602d9703d2a4c6"",""53e9b130b7602d9703bb2233"",""53e9acaeb7602d9703689d7f"",""53e9ad98b7602d9703792cf3"",""53e9bb4bb7602d970478cd07"",""53e9ae5cb7602d9703879e73"",""53e9aa95b7602d970340bde2"",""53e9a9b0b7602d970330de3b"",""53e9b0fbb7602d9703b792c9"",""53e9b6b4b7602d97042394bc"",""53e9b0f4b7602d9703b710a9"",""53e998b8b7602d97020ef374"",""53e9ac70b7602d970364263e""]",Kernel Mean Matching with a Large Margin.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35527-1_19""]","{""_id"":""555037437cea80f95417d305"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Advanced Data Mining and Applications"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ADMA"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7713 LNAI,2012,Advanced Data Mining and Applications,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications (ADMA),"{""_id"":""53f43be1dabfaee4dc7b61ff"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Huifang Deng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[6],1

 An algorithm for alternate pattern fill on arbitrary line segments, circular arcs and elliptical arcs is proposed in this
 paper. The algorithm creates an external loop which is a minimal loop that contains a given point. And then, all loops that
 delimit the nested regions for the alternate pattern fill inside the external loop are built. The loop detection is based
 on a new method for searching the leftmost edges. It requires only values of positions, tangent vectors, curvature radii,
 and the first derivatives of curvature radii at intersection points and areas of circles and ellipses. After all necessary
 loops are built, the given pattern is filled in the nested loops inside the external loop. Filling the given pattern in this
 paper is simplified into filling line segment patterns on some parallel lines.

 other, especially among those of different networks. Under such situation, overlapping implementation of network management
 functions in the same network domain commonly exists, and end-to-end management can’t be smoothly implemented across different
 network domain. To solve these problems, a novel model of network management architecture is proposed, by name, Internet Management
 Network (IMN. IMN is an overlay network of NMSes. The structure of IMN is almost the same like Internet itself. A prototype
 system based on SNMP is also introduced with an interesting application, multi-domain search engine of network management

From a single video sequence with a moving foreground object and stationary background, our algorithm combines background subtraction, color and contrast cues to extract a foreground layer accurately and efficiently. The key idea in background cut is background con- trast attenuation, which adaptively attenuates the contrasts in the background while preserving the contrasts across foreground/background boundaries. Our algorithm builds upon a key observation that the contrast (or more precisely, color image gradient in the background is dissimilar to the contrast across fore- ground/background boundaries in most cases. Using background cut, the layer extraction errorscaused by background cluttercan be substantially reduced. More- over, we present an adaptive mixture model of global and per-pixel background colors toimprove the robustnessofour systemundervarious background changes.

JianYing Cui,53e997d1b7602d9701fc7844,"Describing the interactional behavior of rational agents and seeking equilibria are two main domains of game theory. The epistemic
 foundation of the above two domains is based on the assumption that all players are rational. However, game theory itself
 cannot precisely model the higher-order information changes of mutual knowledge among players, so in the current studies of
 game theory the interpretations of rationality are vague. In this paper, a concept of the rationality is redefined through
 incorporating an epistemic ingredient. Then a method is proposed to solve and refine Nash equilibria which is grounded on
 public announcement logic, and it is proved that the iterated announcement of this rationality assertion characterizes the
 iterated admissibility algorithm in game theory, which offers a dynamic epistemic foundation for this algorithm. Finally,
 an implementation of this method, based on the extended DEMO, is shown to be correct.","[{""_id"":""542ce599dabfae4b91c2cdf9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869d13e1cd8e14a3a02894"",""name"":""JianYing Cui"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest University Institute of Logic and Intelligence Chongqing 400715 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b35e1c455f439fe42616"",""orgs"":[""Southwest Univ, Inst Log & Intelligence, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f471a4dabfaee02adc0c34"",""bio"":null,""email"":""tangxj@swu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b869d13e1cd8e14a3a02894"",""name"":""XiaoJia Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest University Institute of Logic and Intelligence Chongqing 400715 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b35e1c455f439fe42616"",""orgs"":[""Southwest Univ, Inst Log & Intelligence, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-010-4010-0,"[""Mathematical economics"",""Rationality"",""Rational agent"",""Best response"",""Implementation theory"",""Non-credible threat"",""Game theory"",""Normal-form game"",""Nash equilibrium"",""Mathematics""]",,18622836,7,"[""game theory"",""rational agent"",""higher order"",""nash equilibria""]",en,4,1368,1358,null,"[""53e9a3b3b7602d9702cc39d6"",""56d90d12dabfae2eee23a549"",""53e9a42bb7602d9702d48474"",""53e9b572b7602d97040ab1f5"",""53e99cfcb7602d97025af166"",""53e99d45b7602d97025fd240"",""53e9ac3db7602d9703606fb6""]",A method for solving Nash equilibria of games based on public announcement logic,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-010-4010-0"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-010-4010-0"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b77cea80f95414b7de"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Science China Information Sciences"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",53,2010,Sci.

In this paper, an adaptive routing protocol that makes use of both self-aware and destination-aware utility metrics to evaluate the potential throughput between every pair of nodes is proposed. We theoretically analyze the nodes' spraying process and discover the relationship between the initial number of copies and the latency of the message distribution process, by which we can further control the expected latency under a certain level.

To get a fully connected and secure network, we introduce secrecy transfer which combines random graph and random geometric graph via the propagation of acquaintanceship to produce an acquaintanceship graph G n,n0, a kind of random geometric graph with each edge representing an acquaintanceship between two nodes. We find that components of graph G n,n0 that undergoes a phase transition from small components to a giant component when n 0 is larger than a threshold, the threshold for G n,n0 to be a connected graph is derived.

Jie Hu,53e997fcb7602d970200547c,"Real world objects are essentially networked through various natural and complex relationships with each other. Existing data
 models such as semantic data models, object-oriented data models, and role models oversimplify and ignore such relationships
 and mainly focus on the roles that objects play, and properties they have with these roles independent of their relationships.
 As a result, they fail to naturally and directly model various kinds of relationships between objects, between objects and

Jilong Wang,53e997fcb7602d9702004e73,"Currently, network management systems on Internet are lots of islands floating around. They seldom get connected with each
 other, especially among those of different networks. Under such situation, overlapping implementation of network management
 functions in the same network domain commonly exists, and end-to-end management can’t be smoothly implemented across different
 network domain. To solve these problems, a novel model of network management architecture is proposed, by name, Internet Management
 Network (IMN. IMN is an overlay network of NMSes. The structure of IMN is almost the same like Internet itself. A prototype
 system based on SNMP is also introduced with an interesting application, multi-domain search engine of network management
 information.

Land resource is not only the natural carrier of carbon emission of land ecosystems, but also the spatial carrier of carbon emission from human society. Human activity and its carbon emission intension have a very close relationship with the land use pattern, exploration on the low-carbon oriented land use scope, and land use structure can effectively reduce the rate of carbon emission, and also provides consults to low-carbon oriented land use planning. This paper presents a multi-objective land use optimization model based on low-carbon development. Carbon emission, economic benefit objectives, and constraint conditions are integrated into the multi-objectives optimization model of land use, and the model was solved with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II.

Jintai Ding,53e997ccb7602d9701fbe567,"In this paper, we try to clarify some of the questions related to a key concept in multivariate polynomial solving algorithm over a finite field: the degree of regularity. By the degree of regularity, here we refer to a concept first presented by Dubois and Gama, namely the lowest degree at which certain nontrivial degree drop of a polynomial systemoccurs. Currently, it is somehow commonly accepted that we can use this degree to estimate the complexity of solving a polynomial system, even though we do not have systematic empirical data or a theory to support such a claim. In this paper, we would like to clarify the situation with the help of experiments. We first define a concept of solving degree for a polynomial system. The key question we then need to clarify is the connection of solving degree and the degree of regularity with focus on quadratic systems. To exclude the cases that do not represent the general situation, we need to define when a system is degenerate and when it is irreducible. With extensive computer experiments, we show that the two concepts, the degree of regularity and the solving degree, are related for irreducible systems in the sense that the difference between the two degrees is indeed small, less than 3. But due to the limitation of our experiments, we speculate that this may not be the case for high degree cases. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","[{""_id"":""53f42f32dabfaeb2ac0010b1"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jintai Ding"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f45e10dabfaedf43626eb2"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Dieter Schmidt"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-42001-6_4,"[""Finite field"",""Polynomial"",""Square-free polynomial"",""Quadratic equation"",""Pure mathematics"",""Degree of a polynomial"",""Homogeneous polynomial"",""Reciprocal polynomial"",""Matrix polynomial"",""Mathematics""]",,16113349,null,"[""degree of regularity"",""hfe"",""hfev"",""non-degenerate system"",""random polynomial system"",""solving degree""]",en,6,49,34,null,"[""53e99d04b7602d97025b9537"",""53e9bce8b7602d970496b265"",""53e9b1aab7602d9703c389d6"",""53e9b790b7602d9704338bde"",""53e9a85cb7602d97031a4789"",""53e9b241b7602d9703ce1d75"",""53e99f28b7602d97027f7ca6"",""53e9b295b7602d9703d3d5da"",""53e9b77db7602d9704322d57"",""53e9b716b7602d97042b00f4"",""53e9b740b7602d97042d8511"",""53e9ba32b7602d970463fd28"",""53e9abaab7602d9703556038"",""53e9a010b7602d97028f126a""]",Solving Degree and Degree of Regularity for Polynomial Systems over a Finite Fields.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-42001-6_4""]","{""_id"":""5390799820f770854f5c0fb4"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":null,""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Number theory and cryptography"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",8260 LNCS,2013,Number Theory and Cryptography,null,"{""_id"":""53f42f32dabfaeb2ac0010b1"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jintai Ding"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[6],1

In this paper, an adaptive routing protocol that makes use of both self-aware and destination-aware utility metrics to evaluate the potential throughput between every pair of nodes is proposed. We theoretically analyze the nodes' spraying process and discover the relationship between the initial number of copies and the latency of the message distribution process, by which we can further control the expected latency under a certain level.

 An algorithm for alternate pattern fill on arbitrary line segments, circular arcs and elliptical arcs is proposed in this
 paper. The algorithm creates an external loop which is a minimal loop that contains a given point. And then, all loops that
 delimit the nested regions for the alternate pattern fill inside the external loop are built. The loop detection is based
 on a new method for searching the leftmost edges. It requires only values of positions, tangent vectors, curvature radii,
 and the first derivatives of curvature radii at intersection points and areas of circles and ellipses. After all necessary
 loops are built, the given pattern is filled in the nested loops inside the external loop. Filling the given pattern in this
 paper is simplified into filling line segment patterns on some parallel lines.

Junjun Wang,53e997ccb7602d9701fbf933,"Observation on query log of search engine indicates that queries are usually ambiguous. Similar to document ranking, search intents should be ranked to facilitate information search. Previous work attempts to rank intents with merely relevance score. We argue that diversity is also important. In this work, unified models are proposed to rank intents underlying a query by combining relevance score and diversity degree, in which the latter is reflected by non-overlapping ratio of every intent and aggregated non-overlapping ratio of a set of intents. Three conclusions are drawn according to the experiment results. Firstly, diversity plays an important role in intent ranking. Secondly, URL is more effective than similarity in detecting unique subtopics. Thirdly, the aggregated non-overlapping ratio makes some contribution in similarity based intent ranking but little in URL based intent ranking. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[{""_id"":""53f4542edabfaec09f1fe41d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yunqing Xia"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f433c2dabfaee0d9b4b7a9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaoshi Zhong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f437b5dabfaee1c0aa9512"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guoyu Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5409580ddabfae450f47981d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Junjun Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a4637dabfae646d547b98"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiang Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa115adabfae7f97b04ca8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Thomas Fang Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f456abdabfaedd74e2f16a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qinan Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43325dabfaee43ec0e0ed"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Sen Na"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4d485dabfaeedd0782335"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaohai Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23,"[""Search engine"",""Query log"",""Information retrieval"",""Ranking"",""Computer science"",""Ranking (information retrieval""]",,16113349,null,"[""aggregated non-overlapping ratio"",""diversity"",""intent ranking"",""non-overlapping ratio"",""relevance""]",en,2,271,266,null,"[""53e9b180b7602d9703c068bd"",""573697446e3b12023e6319c1"",""573697446e3b12023e631ab0"",""573697446e3b12023e631cdc"",""573697446e3b12023e631a50"",""53e99a14b7602d970226763d"",""573697446e3b12023e631aa1"",""53e9b50bb7602d97040406b8""]",Ranking Search Intents Underlying a Query.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23""]","{""_id"":""5550379f7cea80f954193043"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""NLDB"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7934 LNCS,2013,Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases,International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases (NLDB),"{""_id"":""5409580ddabfae450f47981d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Junjun Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[2],1
Ke Deng,53e997f1b7602d9701fee626,"
 The aim of duplicate detection is to group records in a relation which refer to the same entity in the real world such as
 a person or business. Most existing works require user specified parameters such as similarity threshold in order to conduct
 duplicate detection. These methods are called user-first in this paper. However, in many scenarios, pre-specification from
 the user is very hard and often unreliable, thus limiting applicability of user-first methods. In this paper, we propose a
 user-last method, called Active Duplicate Detection (ADD, where an initial solution is returned without forcing user to specify such parameters and then user is involved to refine
 the initial solution. Different from user-first methods where user makes decision before any processing, ADD allows user to
 make decision based on an initial solution. The identified initial solution in ADD enjoys comparatively high quality and is
 easy to be refined in a systematic way (at almost zero cost.

Kuanquan Wang,53e997f1b7602d9701ff1f66,"Traditional cryptosystems are based on passwords, which can be cracked (simple ones or forgotten (complex ones. This paper
 proposes a novel cryptosystem based on palmprints. This system directly uses the palmprint as a key to encrypt/decrypt information.
 The information of a palmprint is so complex that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to crack the system while it need
 not remember anything to use the system. In the encrypting phase, a 1024 bits binary string is extracted from the palmprints
 using differential operations. Then the string is translated to a 128 bits encrypting key using a Hash function, and at the
 same time, an error-correct-code (ECC is generated. Some general encryption algorithms use the 128 bits encrypting key to
 encrypt the secret information. In decrypting phase, the 1024 bits binary string extracted from the input palmprint is first
 corrected using the ECC. Then the corrected string is translated to a decrypting key using the same Hash function. Finally,
 the corresponding general decryption algorithms use decrypting key to decrypt the information. The experimental results show
 that the accuracy and security of this system can meet the requirement of most applications.

Kun Tan,53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b,"A fundamental challenge in data center networking is how to efficiently interconnect an exponentially increasing number of servers. This paper presents DCell, a novel network structure that has many desirable features for data center networking. DCell is a recursively defined structure, in which a high-level DCell is constructed from many low-level DCells and DCells at the same level are fully connected with one another. DCell scales doubly exponentially as the node degree increases. DCell is fault tolerant since it does not have single point of failure and its distributed fault-tolerant routing protocol performs near shortest-path routing even in the presence of severe link or node failures.

However, the use of a topic model solely sometimes unable to achieve the expected high performance, it is very necessary to improve the current topic model to cope with the characteristic of texts and specific requirements. In this paper, we focus on two tasks. One is to make use of different external corpus to identify topics from texts for better categorization. The other is to add the weight of a few features in texts to get some other topics from those of topic model. We further evaluate the performance of the two tasks with baseline results. The experiments show that our proposed method can achieve a higher accuracy in text classification.

Lei Shi,53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b,"A fundamental challenge in data center networking is how to efficiently interconnect an exponentially increasing number of servers. This paper presents DCell, a novel network structure that has many desirable features for data center networking. DCell is a recursively defined structure, in which a high-level DCell is constructed from many low-level DCells and DCells at the same level are fully connected with one another. DCell scales doubly exponentially as the node degree increases. DCell is fault tolerant since it does not have single point of failure and its distributed fault-tolerant routing protocol performs near shortest-path routing even in the presence of severe link or node failures. DCell also provides higher network capacity than the traditional tree-based structure for various types of services. Furthermore, DCell can be incrementally expanded and a partial DCell provides the same appealing features. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that DCell is a viable interconnection structure for data centers.","[{""_id"":""53f7a457dabfae9060ad6dfd"",""bio"":null,""email"":""chguo@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Chuanxiong Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a50f5dabfae61d4969d02"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hwu@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Haitao Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54084fdedabfae44f087b22e"",""bio"":null,""email"":""kuntan@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Kun Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f5634adabfae5e5bf80463"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Lei Shi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4630fdabfaeb22f52f212"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ygz@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Yongguang Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4792fdabfaec09f2882e2"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zslu@cs.ucla.edu"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Songwu Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1145/1402946.1402968,"[""Single point of failure"",""Data center network architectures"",""Computer science"",""Server"",""Computer network"",""Network topology"",""Bisection bandwidth"",""Fault tolerance"",""Distributed computing"",""Routing protocol"",""Scalability""]",,01464833,4,"[""data center"",""network topology"",""throughput"",""fault tolerance""]",en,1143,86,75,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b_0.pdf,"[""53e99d4bb7602d9702602ec7"",""53e99adcb7602d9702360f1e"",""53e9ac2eb7602d97035f4104"",""599c7f2d601a182cd28f68d5"",""53e9ab69b7602d970350990d"",""557cf1336feeaa8086da40ad"",""53e99b78b7602d970241f5f5"",""53e99cfdb7602d97025b2103"",""55827efb0cf2bf7bae57aa4e"",""53e9bb52b7602d9704790954""]",Dcell: a scalable and fault-tolerant network structure for data centers,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402946.1402968"",""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555037717cea80f9541880b1"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""ACM SIGCOMM Conference (SIGCOMM)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SIGCOMM"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",38,2008,SIGCOMM,ACM SIGCOMM Conference (SIGCOMM),"{""_id"":""53f5634adabfae5e5bf80463"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Lei Shi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[1143],1
Lei Yi,53e997ddb7602d9701fd5c11,"Nowadays, numerous social videos have pervaded on the Web. Social web videos are characterized with the accompanying rich contextual information which describe the content of videos and thus greatly facilitate video search and browsing. Generally those context data such as tags are generated for the whole video, without temporal indication on when they actually appear in the video. However, many tags only describe parts of the video content. Therefore, tag localization, the process of assigning tags to the underlying relevant video segments or frames is gaining increasing research interests and a benchmark dataset for the fair evaluation of tag localization algorithms is highly desirable. In this paper, we describe and release a dataset called DUT-WEBV, which contains 1550 videos collected from YouTube portal by issuing 31 concepts as queries. These concepts cover a wide range of semantic aspects including scenes like ""mountain"", events like ""flood"", objects like ""cows"", sites like ""gas station"", and activities like ""handshaking"", offering great challenges to the tag (i.e., concept localization task. For each video of a tag, we carefully annotate the time durations when the tag appears in the video. Besides the video itself, the contextual information, such as thumbnail images, titles, and categories, is also provided. Together with this benchmark dataset, we present a baseline for tag localization using multiple instance learning approach. Finally, we discuss some open research issues for tag localization in web videos. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""54084d74dabfae450f40a183"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Haojie Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43277dabfaec09f154ff5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lei Yi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa014edabfae8faa59f244"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yue Guan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4714ddabfaeb22f5592bd"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hao Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_29,"[""Open research"",""Thumbnail"",""Contextual information"",""World Wide Web"",""Social web"",""Information retrieval"",""Video retrieval"",""Computer science"",""Video annotation"",""Handshaking"",""Context data""]",,16113349,PART 2,"[""tag localization"",""video annotation"",""video retrieval""]",en,10,315,305,null,"[""53e9ba94b7602d97046b9e43"",""53e9b27bb7602d9703d213ed"",""53e998b8b7602d97020f1238"",""53e99e31b7602d97026f707b"",""53e9bb8cb7602d97047d329e"",""53e9bda5b7602d9704a4f32a"",""53e9b03db7602d9703a9b031"",""53e9b8c1b7602d97044a2ec0"",""53e9a2b9b7602d9702bc019e"",""53e99f64b7602d97028348f5"",""53e9a04ab7602d97029326c3"",""53e99e94b7602d970275cb91"",""53e9b937b7602d97045221ad"",""53e99c52b7602d9702500b5f"",""558c5f1784ae6766fdf2b146"",""53e9a7b3b7602d97030eca94"",""53e9b3d4b7602d9703ebe970"",""53e99a6eb7602d97022dfb95"",""53e9b627b7602d970417fdae""]",DUT-WEBV: A Benchmark Dataset for Performance Evaluation of Tag Localization for Web Video.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_29""]","{""_id"":""53a72cac20f7420be8c4c673"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Conference on Multimedia Modeling"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7733 LNCS,2013,Conference on Multimedia Modeling,International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP),"{""_id"":""53f43277dabfaec09f154ff5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lei Yi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[10],1
Lei You,53e997ddb7602d9701fd31c1,"The nonexistence of an end-to-end path poses great challenges in directly adapting the traditional routing algorithms for ad hoc or mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs to delay tolerant networks (DTNs. In this paper, an adaptive routing protocol that makes use of both self-aware and destination-aware utility metrics to evaluate the potential throughput between every pair of nodes is proposed. We theoretically analyze the nodes' spraying process and discover the relationship between the initial number of copies and the latency of the message distribution process, by which we can further control the expected latency under a certain level. Compared with Epidemic, Spray And Wait Spray, And Focus and Encounter-based routing, our proposed algorithm is the only one that achieves comparable performance under both Helsinki City Scenario and Cambridge-iMote Scenario. ? 2014 Lei You et al.","[{""_id"":""53f42c7fdabfaee1c0a2603d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lei You"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542c2053dabfae2b4e1e2d65"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jianbo Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f3a02edabfae4b34ab518e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Changjiang Wei"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f438bcdabfaeb1a7c09f15"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Chenqu Dai"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f44f8ddabfaee2a1d58fed"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jixing Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1155/2014/742047,"[""Link-state routing protocol"",""Dynamic Source Routing"",""Computer science"",""Static routing"",""Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector routing"",""Computer network"",""Wireless Routing Protocol"",""Ad hoc wireless distribution service"",""Adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing"",""Optimized Link State Routing Protocol"",""Distributed computing""]",,15501477,null,[],en,2,null,null,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997ddb7602d9701fd31c1_0.pdf,"[""53e9a2dcb7602d9702be6dae"",""53e9abf1b7602d97035b1a59"",""53e9b2b8b7602d9703d60e5a"",""53e9b27bb7602d9703d203b9"",""53e99cfdb7602d97025b4823"",""53e9b833b7602d97043edafa"",""53e9b5b6b7602d97040fefb2"",""53e9b281b7602d9703d2b537"",""53e999e0b7602d9702225fc4"",""558af1cce4b031bae1fa9d61"",""53e99f42b7602d9702814fad"",""53e9b4cab7602d9703fe9304"",""53e9a6edb7602d9703022fbe"",""599c7c62601a182cd27a868d"",""5550423445ce0a409eb408ea"",""53e99c84b7602d970253697a"",""53e9a108b7602d97029f6552""]",A General and Specific Utility-Based Adaptive Routing for Delay Tolerant Networks.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/742047"",""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1155/2014/742047""]","{""_id"":""53a731d520f7420be8d651d2"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""IJDSN"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",2014,2014,International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks,International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks,"{""_id"":""53f42c7fdabfaee1c0a2603d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lei You"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[2],1

However, the use of a topic model solely sometimes unable to achieve the expected high performance, it is very necessary to improve the current topic model to cope with the characteristic of texts and specific requirements. In this paper, we focus on two tasks. One is to make use of different external corpus to identify topics from texts for better categorization. The other is to add the weight of a few features in texts to get some other topics from those of topic model. We further evaluate the performance of the two tasks with baseline results. The experiments show that our proposed method can achieve a higher accuracy in text classification. The approach can find truly representative words which may contribute to wide acceptance of topic models in micro-blog analysis. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[{""_id"":""54486f49dabfae87b7e232b5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ying Zhu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest China Normal University(Southwest University,Southwest China Normal University,Southwest Normal University,Chongqing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b35e1c455f439fe42616"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""56019da145cedb3395e80f4f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Li Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest China Normal University(Southwest University,Southwest China Normal University,Southwest Normal University,Chongqing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b35e1c455f439fe42616"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46a10dabfaec09f24e4af"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Le Luo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest China Normal University(Southwest University,Southwest China Normal University,Southwest Normal University,Chongqing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b35e1c455f439fe42616"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-39787-5-41,"[""Categorization"",""Computer science"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Natural language processing"",""Topic analysis"",""Topic model""]",,16113349,null,"[""lda model"",""text classification"",""topic analysis"",""twitter""]",en,18,503,493,null,"[""53e9983db7602d9702065035"",""53e99976b7602d97021b8b95"",""53e9bb0fb7602d970474ae2d"",""53e999cbb7602d97022100a2"",""53e9a45cb7602d9702d783b7"",""53e9ae97b7602d97038bbbef"",""53e9b68db7602d97041fb604"",""53e9abebb7602d97035a7132"",""53e9b9c1b7602d97045b7299"",""53e9a69fb7602d9702fcf1e0"",""53e9a55cb7602d9702e7f30c"",""53e9a97ab7602d97032d1968"",""53e9ac5cb7602d970362e6af"",""53e99d9eb7602d970265d94c"",""53e9b239b7602d9703cd5e18""]",Learning to Classify Short Text with Topic Model and External Knowledge.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39787-5-41"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39787-5_41""]","{""_id"":""555037cf7cea80f95419b172"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Knowledge Science, Engineering and Management"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""KSEM"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",8041 LNAI,2013,"Knowledge Science, Engineering and Management",International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA),"{""_id"":""56019da145cedb3395e80f4f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Li Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest China Normal University(Southwest University,Southwest China Normal University,Southwest Normal University,Chongqing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b35e1c455f439fe42616"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[18],1

 In this paper, a new system called ridgelets frame in L2 (R2 is constructed. To construct the new system, we use other orthonormal wavelet rather than Meyer wavelet, which was used
 in the construction of orthonormal ridgelets by Donoho. Due to the losing of two special closure properties of Meyer wavelet,
 the new system is a tight frame with frame bound 1 instead of orthonormal basis for L2 (R2. As an example, we demonstrate the potential power of the new constructed system by showing its ability of recovering the
 line structure in images in the presence of noise.

 An algorithm for alternate pattern fill on arbitrary line segments, circular arcs and elliptical arcs is proposed in this
 paper. The algorithm creates an external loop which is a minimal loop that contains a given point. And then, all loops that
 delimit the nested regions for the alternate pattern fill inside the external loop are built. The loop detection is based
 on a new method for searching the leftmost edges. It requires only values of positions, tangent vectors, curvature radii,
 and the first derivatives of curvature radii at intersection points and areas of circles and ellipses. After all necessary
 loops are built, the given pattern is filled in the nested loops inside the external loop. Filling the given pattern in this
 paper is simplified into filling line segment patterns on some parallel lines.

Ling Shao,53e997cbb7602d9701fbbb9a,"Interactive image matting is a process that extracts a foreground object from an image based on limited user input. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive image matting algorithm named Perfect Snapping which is inspired by the presented method named Lazy Snapping technique. In the algorithm, the mean shift algorithm with a boundary confidence prior is introduced to efficiently pre-segment the original image into homogeneous regions (super-pixels with precise boundary. Secondly, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM clustering algorithm is used to describe and to model the super-pixels. Finally, a Monte Carlo based Expectation Maximization (EM algorithm is used to perform parametric learning of mixture model for priori knowledge. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher matting quality with higher efficiency. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""56cb1899c35f4f3c6565413c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qingsong Zhu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""560196de45cedb3395e7efd5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ling Shao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f48c16dabfaea7cd1ce195"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qi Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42e44dabfaee0d9b087e6"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaoqin Xie"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_8,null,null,16113349,PART 2,"[""Interactive image matting"",""Lazy snapping"",""Mean shift algorithm""]",en,0,87,79,,null,Perfect Snapping.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_8""]","{""_id"":""53a72cac20f7420be8c4c673"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Conference on Multi-Media Modeling (MMM)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":null}",7733 LNCS,2013,MMM,International Conference on Multi-Media Modeling (MMM),"{""_id"":""560196de45cedb3395e7efd5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ling Shao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[0],0

 The aim of duplicate detection is to group records in a relation which refer to the same entity in the real world such as
 a person or business. Most existing works require user specified parameters such as similarity threshold in order to conduct
 duplicate detection. These methods are called user-first in this paper. However, in many scenarios, pre-specification from
 the user is very hard and often unreliable, thus limiting applicability of user-first methods. In this paper, we propose a
 user-last method, called Active Duplicate Detection (ADD, where an initial solution is returned without forcing user to specify such parameters and then user is involved to refine
 the initial solution. Different from user-first methods where user makes decision before any processing, ADD allows user to
 make decision based on an initial solution. The identified initial solution in ADD enjoys comparatively high quality and is
 easy to be refined in a systematic way (at almost zero cost.

Long Sang Chiu,53e997ddb7602d9701fd4641,"Analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of respirable suspended particulates (RSP observed in 11 Hong Kong general stations over the period 2000-2008 shows a high concentration in the northwest and low concentration in the southeast and coastal areas, with the central area in between. Seasonally, RSP concentration is highest in winter, followed by autumn, and is lowest in summer. A bimodal peak in diurnal cycle with peaks in the morning (7-8 a.m. and early evening (6-7 p.m. can be attributed to rush-hour traffic flows as well as local land-sea breeze circulations. The effect of vehicular emission is also demonstrated in a distinct weekly cycle, with a Sunday minimum. Analysis of RSP concentration for different wind directions shows the importance of cross-boundary transport of pollutants from the Pearl River Delta area, with 43% of noncompliant cases associated with cross-boundary transport. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF analysis shows that the first EOF pattern of RSP changes is characterized by changes of the same sign for all 11 general stations, with the second pattern dominated by changes in the Yuen Long station. Time series analysis shows that changes in the second EOF leads the first, indicating that changes in Yuen Long (northwest precede changes elsewhere. Stations located in the coastal area change last. Tap Mun shows significant increasing trends in RSP concentration, particularly for incidences of high RSP occurrences, which may be attributed to increases in shipping in the Yan Tian International Container Terminal. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","[{""_id"":""53f43873dabfaedce554235a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Long Sang Chiu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42d9fdabfaee1c0a36b9a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Raymond Kwok-Cheung Lok"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1080/19475683.2011.576269,"[""Meteorology"",""Particulates"",""Evening"",""Pollution"",""Pollutant"",""Wind direction"",""Atmospheric sciences"",""Empirical orthogonal functions"",""Diurnal cycle"",""Morning"",""Geography""]",,19475691,2,"[""cross-boundary transport"",""pearl river delta"",""pollution"",""rsp"",""time series analysis"",""empirical orthogonal function"",""diurnal cycle"",""sea breeze"",""seasonality"",""traffic flow""]",en,0,124,113,null,"[""53e9b0ccb7602d9703b479d1""]",Variations of respirable suspended particulates in Hong Kong: cross-boundary and local effects.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19475683.2011.576269""]","{""_id"":""555036f87cea80f95416b5fe"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Annals of Gis: Geographic Information Sciences"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Annals of GIS"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",17,2011,Annals of Gis: Geographic Information Sciences,null,"{""_id"":""53f43873dabfaedce554235a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Long Sang Chiu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[0],0
Mengchi Liu,53e997fcb7602d970200547c,"Real world objects are essentially networked through various natural and complex relationships with each other. Existing data
 models such as semantic data models, object-oriented data models, and role models oversimplify and ignore such relationships
 and mainly focus on the roles that objects play, and properties they have with these roles independent of their relationships.
 As a result, they fail to naturally and directly model various kinds of relationships between objects, between objects and

 this paper, we propose a novel data model called Information Networking Model that can overcome these limitations.

Miaohui Zhang,53e997fcb7602d9702004e73,"Currently, network management systems on Internet are lots of islands floating around. They seldom get connected with each
 other, especially among those of different networks. Under such situation, overlapping implementation of network management
 functions in the same network domain commonly exists, and end-to-end management can’t be smoothly implemented across different
 network domain. To solve these problems, a novel model of network management architecture is proposed, by name, Internet Management
 Network (IMN. IMN is an overlay network of NMSes. The structure of IMN is almost the same like Internet itself. A prototype
 system based on SNMP is also introduced with an interesting application, multi-domain search engine of network management

 We describe a method for objective and quantitative evaluation of image quality. The method represents a novel use of image
 enhancement concepts. It employs three new measures that evaluate the definition of contours, uniform intensity distribution,
 and noise rate in determining the image quality. Because the three measures have clear physical meanings, they can be selectively
 applied according to the viewer’s evaluation criteria. The three measures are relatively inexpensive to compute, making them
 suitable for automated ranking of image quality in personal digital imaging devices, such as digital cameras. However, the
 method is equally adept at evaluating other digital images such as those on the Internet. Experiments with the method show
 good correlation with visual quality assessment for various image subject types.

Pei Yang,53e997d1b7602d9701fc2ee0,"Various instance weighting methods have been proposed for instance-based transfer learning. Kernel Mean Matching (KMM is one of the typical instance weighting approaches which estimates the instance importance by matching the two distributions in the universal reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS. However, KMM is an unsupervised learning approach which does not utilize the class label knowledge of the source data. In this paper, we extended KMM by leveraging the class label knowledge and integrated KMM and SVM into an unified optimization framework called KMM-LM (Large Margin. The objective of KMM-LM is to maximize the geometric soft margin, and minimize the empirical classification error together with the domain discrepancy based on KMM simultaneously. KMM-LM utilizes an iterative minimization algorithm to find the optimal weight vector of the classification decision hyperplane and the importance weight vector of the instances in the source domain. The experiments show that KMM-LM outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","[{""_id"":""542a8334dabfae646d56c24a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qi Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43be1dabfaee4dc7b61ff"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Huifang Deng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46961dabfaedf43651dd4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Pei Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35527-1_19,"[""Kernel (linear algebra"",""Weighting"",""Pattern recognition"",""Source data"",""Computer science"",""Support vector machine"",""Unsupervised learning"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Hyperplane"",""Variable kernel density estimation"",""Reproducing kernel Hilbert space""]",,16113349,null,"[""instance weighting"",""kernel mean matching"",""large margin"",""transfer learning""]",en,6,234,223,null,"[""53e9a965b7602d97032bc8a8"",""53e99d1ab7602d97025ce3c8"",""53e99f69b7602d970283b36f"",""53e9997eb7602d97021bdc19"",""53e9a3abb7602d9702cb8866"",""53e99bdcb7602d970248324c"",""53e99a0eb7602d970225d18a"",""53e9ab6fb7602d970350dc5d"",""53e9b281b7602d9703d2a4c6"",""53e9b130b7602d9703bb2233"",""53e9acaeb7602d9703689d7f"",""53e9ad98b7602d9703792cf3"",""53e9bb4bb7602d970478cd07"",""53e9ae5cb7602d9703879e73"",""53e9aa95b7602d970340bde2"",""53e9a9b0b7602d970330de3b"",""53e9b0fbb7602d9703b792c9"",""53e9b6b4b7602d97042394bc"",""53e9b0f4b7602d9703b710a9"",""53e998b8b7602d97020ef374"",""53e9ac70b7602d970364263e""]",Kernel Mean Matching with a Large Margin.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35527-1_19""]","{""_id"":""555037437cea80f95417d305"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Advanced Data Mining and Applications"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ADMA"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7713 LNAI,2012,Advanced Data Mining and Applications,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications (ADMA),"{""_id"":""53f46961dabfaedf43651dd4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Pei Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[6],1

Ping Jiang,53e997ecb7602d9701fe9ae3,"In this paper we present a model of autapses which are synapses connecting axons and dendrites of the same neuron and feeding back axonal ac- tion potentials to the own dendritic tree. The timely physiological self- inhibitory function they may serve, indicated by the spike-timing dependent plasticity rule, provides a potential negative feedback mechanism to control the dynamical properties of neurons. As one of the major neuro-computational properties, bursting occurs due to the interplay of fast currents responsible for spiking activity, and slow currents that modulate the activity. The model au- tapse is applied to a neuron with conductance-based minimal model to con- struct a fast-slow buster. Three types of bursting that the burster exhibits are analyzed geometrically through phase portraits to illustrate the modulation competence of the autapse model on bursting.","[{""_id"":""53f43ecfdabfaeecd6998bb6"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ghwangtj@hotmail.com"",""gid"":""5b86a7e9e1cd8e14a3e6e76b"",""name"":""Guang-hong Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Information and Control Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c31c455f439fe3e151"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a38f2dabfae646d541833"",""bio"":null,""email"":""P.Jiang@bradford.ac.uk"",""gid"":""5b86a7e9e1cd8e14a3e6e76b"",""name"":""Ping Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Information and Control Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c31c455f439fe3e151"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/11759966_52,"[""Bursting"",""Synapse"",""Neuroscience"",""Autapse"",""Minimal model"",""Negative feedback"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Theta model"",""Neuron"",""Phase portrait"",""Physics""]",3-540-34439-X,16113349,,"[""own dendritic tree"",""autapse model"",""burster exhibit"",""axonal action potential"",""dynamical property"",""modulation competence"",""model autapse"",""conductance-based minimal model"",""phase portrait"",""fast-slow buster"",""negative feedback""]",en,1,343,334,null,"[""53e9ab69b7602d970350687b"",""53e9afdbb7602d9703a31a30""]",Autapse Modulated Bursting,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11759966_52"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""53e18cfa20f7dfbc07e904fc"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Symposium on Neural Networks (ISNN)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""International Symposium on Neural Networks"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":2}",3971,2006,ISNN,International Symposium on Neural Networks (ISNN),"{""_id"":""542a38f2dabfae646d541833"",""bio"":null,""email"":""P.Jiang@bradford.ac.uk"",""gid"":""5b86a7e9e1cd8e14a3e6e76b"",""name"":""Ping Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Department of Information and Control Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c31c455f439fe3e151"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[1],1
Qi Li,53e997cbb7602d9701fbbb9a,"Interactive image matting is a process that extracts a foreground object from an image based on limited user input. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive image matting algorithm named Perfect Snapping which is inspired by the presented method named Lazy Snapping technique. In the algorithm, the mean shift algorithm with a boundary confidence prior is introduced to efficiently pre-segment the original image into homogeneous regions (super-pixels with precise boundary. Secondly, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM clustering algorithm is used to describe and to model the super-pixels. Finally, a Monte Carlo based Expectation Maximization (EM algorithm is used to perform parametric learning of mixture model for priori knowledge. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher matting quality with higher efficiency. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""56cb1899c35f4f3c6565413c"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qingsong Zhu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""560196de45cedb3395e7efd5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Ling Shao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f48c16dabfaea7cd1ce195"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qi Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42e44dabfaee0d9b087e6"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaoqin Xie"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_8,null,null,16113349,PART 2,"[""Interactive image matting"",""Lazy snapping"",""Mean shift algorithm""]",en,0,87,79,,null,Perfect Snapping.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_8""]","{""_id"":""53a72cac20f7420be8c4c673"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Conference on Multi-Media Modeling (MMM)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":null}",7733 LNCS,2013,MMM,International Conference on Multi-Media Modeling (MMM),"{""_id"":""53f48c16dabfaea7cd1ce195"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qi Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[0],0
Qi Tan,53e997d1b7602d9701fc2ee0,"Various instance weighting methods have been proposed for instance-based transfer learning. Kernel Mean Matching (KMM is one of the typical instance weighting approaches which estimates the instance importance by matching the two distributions in the universal reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS. However, KMM is an unsupervised learning approach which does not utilize the class label knowledge of the source data. In this paper, we extended KMM by leveraging the class label knowledge and integrated KMM and SVM into an unified optimization framework called KMM-LM (Large Margin. The objective of KMM-LM is to maximize the geometric soft margin, and minimize the empirical classification error together with the domain discrepancy based on KMM simultaneously. KMM-LM utilizes an iterative minimization algorithm to find the optimal weight vector of the classification decision hyperplane and the importance weight vector of the instances in the source domain. The experiments show that KMM-LM outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","[{""_id"":""542a8334dabfae646d56c24a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qi Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43be1dabfaee4dc7b61ff"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Huifang Deng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f46961dabfaedf43651dd4"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Pei Yang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35527-1_19,"[""Kernel (linear algebra"",""Weighting"",""Pattern recognition"",""Source data"",""Computer science"",""Support vector machine"",""Unsupervised learning"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Hyperplane"",""Variable kernel density estimation"",""Reproducing kernel Hilbert space""]",,16113349,null,"[""instance weighting"",""kernel mean matching"",""large margin"",""transfer learning""]",en,6,234,223,null,"[""53e9a965b7602d97032bc8a8"",""53e99d1ab7602d97025ce3c8"",""53e99f69b7602d970283b36f"",""53e9997eb7602d97021bdc19"",""53e9a3abb7602d9702cb8866"",""53e99bdcb7602d970248324c"",""53e99a0eb7602d970225d18a"",""53e9ab6fb7602d970350dc5d"",""53e9b281b7602d9703d2a4c6"",""53e9b130b7602d9703bb2233"",""53e9acaeb7602d9703689d7f"",""53e9ad98b7602d9703792cf3"",""53e9bb4bb7602d970478cd07"",""53e9ae5cb7602d9703879e73"",""53e9aa95b7602d970340bde2"",""53e9a9b0b7602d970330de3b"",""53e9b0fbb7602d9703b792c9"",""53e9b6b4b7602d97042394bc"",""53e9b0f4b7602d9703b710a9"",""53e998b8b7602d97020ef374"",""53e9ac70b7602d970364263e""]",Kernel Mean Matching with a Large Margin.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35527-1_19""]","{""_id"":""555037437cea80f95417d305"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Advanced Data Mining and Applications"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ADMA"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7713 LNAI,2012,Advanced Data Mining and Applications,International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications (ADMA),"{""_id"":""542a8334dabfae646d56c24a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qi Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[6],1

Qingsong Zhu,53e997cbb7602d9701fbbb9a,"Interactive image matting is a process that extracts a foreground object from an image based on limited user input. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive image matting algorithm named Perfect Snapping which is inspired by the presented method named Lazy Snapping technique. In the algorithm, the mean shift algorithm with a boundary confidence prior is introduced to efficiently pre-segment the original image into homogeneous regions (super-pixels with precise boundary. Secondly, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM clustering algorithm is used to describe and to model the super-pixels. Finally, a Monte Carlo based Expectation Maximization (EM algorithm is used to perform parametric learning of mixture model for priori knowledge.

Seasonally, RSP concentration is highest in winter, followed by autumn, and is lowest in summer. A bimodal peak in diurnal cycle with peaks in the morning (7-8 a.m. and early evening (6-7 p.m. can be attributed to rush-hour traffic flows as well as local land-sea breeze circulations. The effect of vehicular emission is also demonstrated in a distinct weekly cycle, with a Sunday minimum. Analysis of RSP concentration for different wind directions shows the importance of cross-boundary transport of pollutants from the Pearl River Delta area, with 43% of noncompliant cases associated with cross-boundary transport. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF analysis shows that the first EOF pattern of RSP changes is characterized by changes of the same sign for all 11 general stations, with the second pattern dominated by changes in the Yuen Long station. Time series analysis shows that changes in the second EOF leads the first, indicating that changes in Yuen Long (northwest precede changes elsewhere. Stations located in the coastal area change last. Tap Mun shows significant increasing trends in RSP concentration, particularly for incidences of high RSP occurrences, which may be attributed to increases in shipping in the Yan Tian International Container Terminal. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","[{""_id"":""53f43873dabfaedce554235a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Long Sang Chiu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42d9fdabfaee1c0a36b9a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Raymond Kwok-Cheung Lok"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1080/19475683.2011.576269,"[""Meteorology"",""Particulates"",""Evening"",""Pollution"",""Pollutant"",""Wind direction"",""Atmospheric sciences"",""Empirical orthogonal functions"",""Diurnal cycle"",""Morning"",""Geography""]",,19475691,2,"[""cross-boundary transport"",""pearl river delta"",""pollution"",""rsp"",""time series analysis"",""empirical orthogonal function"",""diurnal cycle"",""sea breeze"",""seasonality"",""traffic flow""]",en,0,124,113,null,"[""53e9b0ccb7602d9703b479d1""]",Variations of respirable suspended particulates in Hong Kong: cross-boundary and local effects.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19475683.2011.576269""]","{""_id"":""555036f87cea80f95416b5fe"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Annals of Gis: Geographic Information Sciences"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Annals of GIS"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",17,2011,Annals of Gis: Geographic Information Sciences,null,"{""_id"":""53f42d9fdabfaee1c0a36b9a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Raymond Kwok-Cheung Lok"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[0],0

Rui Su,53e997ccb7602d9701fbe663,"Compared with other existing video coding standards, H.264/AVC can achieve a significant improvement in compression performances.
 A robust criterion named the rate distortion optimization (RDO is employed to select the optimal coding modes and motion
 vectors for each macroblock (MB, which achieves a high compression ratio while leading to a great increase in the complexity
 and computational load unfortunately. In this paper, a fast mode decision algorithm for H.264/AVC intra prediction based on
 integer transform and adaptive threshold is proposed. Before the intra prediction, integer transform operations on the original
 image are executed to find the directions of local textures. According to this direction, only a small part of the possible
 intra prediction modes are tested for RDO calculation at the first step. If the minimum mean absolute error (MMAE of the
 reconstructed block corresponding to the best mode is smaller than an adaptive threshold which depends on the quantization
 parameter (QP, the RDO calculation is terminated. Otherwise, more possible modes need to be tested. The adaptive threshold
 aims to balance the compression performance and the computational load. Simulation results with various video sequences show
 that the fast mode decision algorithm proposed in this paper can accelerate the encoding speed significantly only with negligible
 PSNR loss or bit rate increment.","[{""_id"":""53f49ef4dabfaedce562b85a"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ssurui@mailst.xjtu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86b153e1cd8e14a32552eb"",""name"":""Rui Su"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University School of Electronics and Information Engineering 710049 Shannxi China 710049 Shannxi China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a13d3dabfae646d537833"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b153e1cd8e14a32552eb"",""name"":""Guizhong Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University School of Electronics and Information Engineering 710049 Shannxi China 710049 Shannxi China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42cf9dabfaec09f10ebff"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b153e1cd8e14a32552eb"",""name"":""Tongyu Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University School of Electronics and Information Engineering 710049 Shannxi China 710049 Shannxi China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11760-007-0002-y,"[""Macroblock"",""Context-adaptive variable-length coding"",""Algorithm"",""Coding (social sciences"",""Compression ratio"",""Quantization (signal processing"",""Mathematics"",""Rate–distortion optimization"",""Encoding (memory"",""Context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding""]",,18631711,1,"[""avc · h.264 · intra prediction · jvt · video coding · adaptive threshold · integer transform"",""adaptive thresholding"",""compression ratio"",""mean absolute error"",""rate distortion optimization""]",en,22,27,11,null,"[""53e9bb9bb7602d97047e47d9"",""53e9a0d2b7602d97029bd14b"",""53e9b750b7602d97042ef51c"",""53e9a576b7602d9702e9dd22"",""53e9b93eb7602d97045270c3"",""558a5fefe4b0b32fcb367036"",""558a78cb84ae84d265bdd0cc""]",Fast mode decision algorithm for intra prediction in H.264/AVC with integer transform and adaptive threshold,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11760-007-0002-y"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11760-007-0002-y""]","{""_id"":""555036f27cea80f954168662"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Image, Video, and Multidimensional Signal Processing Workshop (IVMSP)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Signal, Image and Video Processing"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",1,2007,Signal Image Video Process.,"Image, Video, and Multidimensional Signal Processing Workshop (IVMSP)","{""_id"":""53f49ef4dabfaedce562b85a"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ssurui@mailst.xjtu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86b153e1cd8e14a32552eb"",""name"":""Rui Su"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University School of Electronics and Information Engineering 710049 Shannxi China 710049 Shannxi China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[22],1

Shazia Wasim Sadiq,53e997f1b7602d9701fee626,"
 The aim of duplicate detection is to group records in a relation which refer to the same entity in the real world such as
 a person or business. Most existing works require user specified parameters such as similarity threshold in order to conduct
 duplicate detection. These methods are called user-first in this paper. However, in many scenarios, pre-specification from
 the user is very hard and often unreliable, thus limiting applicability of user-first methods. In this paper, we propose a
 user-last method, called Active Duplicate Detection (ADD, where an initial solution is returned without forcing user to specify such parameters and then user is involved to refine
 the initial solution. Different from user-first methods where user makes decision before any processing, ADD allows user to

Songwu Lu,53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b,"A fundamental challenge in data center networking is how to efficiently interconnect an exponentially increasing number of servers. This paper presents DCell, a novel network structure that has many desirable features for data center networking. DCell is a recursively defined structure, in which a high-level DCell is constructed from many low-level DCells and DCells at the same level are fully connected with one another. DCell scales doubly exponentially as the node degree increases. DCell is fault tolerant since it does not have single point of failure and its distributed fault-tolerant routing protocol performs near shortest-path routing even in the presence of severe link or node failures. DCell also provides higher network capacity than the traditional tree-based structure for various types of services. Furthermore, DCell can be incrementally expanded and a partial DCell provides the same appealing features. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that DCell is a viable interconnection structure for data centers.","[{""_id"":""53f7a457dabfae9060ad6dfd"",""bio"":null,""email"":""chguo@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Chuanxiong Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a50f5dabfae61d4969d02"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hwu@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Haitao Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54084fdedabfae44f087b22e"",""bio"":null,""email"":""kuntan@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Kun Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f5634adabfae5e5bf80463"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Lei Shi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4630fdabfaeb22f52f212"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ygz@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Yongguang Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4792fdabfaec09f2882e2"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zslu@cs.ucla.edu"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Songwu Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1145/1402946.1402968,"[""Single point of failure"",""Data center network architectures"",""Computer science"",""Server"",""Computer network"",""Network topology"",""Bisection bandwidth"",""Fault tolerance"",""Distributed computing"",""Routing protocol"",""Scalability""]",,01464833,4,"[""data center"",""network topology"",""throughput"",""fault tolerance""]",en,1143,86,75,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b_0.pdf,"[""53e99d4bb7602d9702602ec7"",""53e99adcb7602d9702360f1e"",""53e9ac2eb7602d97035f4104"",""599c7f2d601a182cd28f68d5"",""53e9ab69b7602d970350990d"",""557cf1336feeaa8086da40ad"",""53e99b78b7602d970241f5f5"",""53e99cfdb7602d97025b2103"",""55827efb0cf2bf7bae57aa4e"",""53e9bb52b7602d9704790954""]",Dcell: a scalable and fault-tolerant network structure for data centers,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402946.1402968"",""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555037717cea80f9541880b1"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""ACM SIGCOMM Conference (SIGCOMM)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SIGCOMM"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",38,2008,SIGCOMM,ACM SIGCOMM Conference (SIGCOMM),"{""_id"":""53f4792fdabfaec09f2882e2"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zslu@cs.ucla.edu"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Songwu Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[1143],1

 In this paper, a new system called ridgelets frame in L2 (R2 is constructed. To construct the new system, we use other orthonormal wavelet rather than Meyer wavelet, which was used
 in the construction of orthonormal ridgelets by Donoho. Due to the losing of two special closure properties of Meyer wavelet,
 the new system is a tight frame with frame bound 1 instead of orthonormal basis for L2 (R2. As an example, we demonstrate the potential power of the new constructed system by showing its ability of recovering the
 line structure in images in the presence of noise.

Thomas Fang Zheng,53e997ccb7602d9701fbf933,"Observation on query log of search engine indicates that queries are usually ambiguous. Similar to document ranking, search intents should be ranked to facilitate information search. Previous work attempts to rank intents with merely relevance score. We argue that diversity is also important. In this work, unified models are proposed to rank intents underlying a query by combining relevance score and diversity degree, in which the latter is reflected by non-overlapping ratio of every intent and aggregated non-overlapping ratio of a set of intents. Three conclusions are drawn according to the experiment results. Firstly, diversity plays an important role in intent ranking. Secondly, URL is more effective than similarity in detecting unique subtopics. Thirdly, the aggregated non-overlapping ratio makes some contribution in similarity based intent ranking but little in URL based intent ranking. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[{""_id"":""53f4542edabfaec09f1fe41d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yunqing Xia"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f433c2dabfaee0d9b4b7a9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaoshi Zhong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f437b5dabfaee1c0aa9512"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guoyu Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5409580ddabfae450f47981d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Junjun Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a4637dabfae646d547b98"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiang Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa115adabfae7f97b04ca8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Thomas Fang Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f456abdabfaedd74e2f16a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qinan Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43325dabfaee43ec0e0ed"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Sen Na"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4d485dabfaeedd0782335"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaohai Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23,"[""Search engine"",""Query log"",""Information retrieval"",""Ranking"",""Computer science"",""Ranking (information retrieval""]",,16113349,null,"[""aggregated non-overlapping ratio"",""diversity"",""intent ranking"",""non-overlapping ratio"",""relevance""]",en,2,271,266,null,"[""53e9b180b7602d9703c068bd"",""573697446e3b12023e6319c1"",""573697446e3b12023e631ab0"",""573697446e3b12023e631cdc"",""573697446e3b12023e631a50"",""53e99a14b7602d970226763d"",""573697446e3b12023e631aa1"",""53e9b50bb7602d97040406b8""]",Ranking Search Intents Underlying a Query.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23""]","{""_id"":""5550379f7cea80f954193043"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""NLDB"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7934 LNCS,2013,Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases,International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases (NLDB),"{""_id"":""53fa115adabfae7f97b04ca8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Thomas Fang Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[2],1
Tongyu Zhang,53e997ccb7602d9701fbe663,"Compared with other existing video coding standards, H.264/AVC can achieve a significant improvement in compression performances.
 A robust criterion named the rate distortion optimization (RDO is employed to select the optimal coding modes and motion
 vectors for each macroblock (MB, which achieves a high compression ratio while leading to a great increase in the complexity
 and computational load unfortunately. In this paper, a fast mode decision algorithm for H.264/AVC intra prediction based on
 integer transform and adaptive threshold is proposed. Before the intra prediction, integer transform operations on the original
 image are executed to find the directions of local textures. According to this direction, only a small part of the possible
 intra prediction modes are tested for RDO calculation at the first step. If the minimum mean absolute error (MMAE of the
 reconstructed block corresponding to the best mode is smaller than an adaptive threshold which depends on the quantization
 parameter (QP, the RDO calculation is terminated. Otherwise, more possible modes need to be tested. The adaptive threshold
 aims to balance the compression performance and the computational load. Simulation results with various video sequences show
 that the fast mode decision algorithm proposed in this paper can accelerate the encoding speed significantly only with negligible
 PSNR loss or bit rate increment.","[{""_id"":""53f49ef4dabfaedce562b85a"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ssurui@mailst.xjtu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b86b153e1cd8e14a32552eb"",""name"":""Rui Su"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University School of Electronics and Information Engineering 710049 Shannxi China 710049 Shannxi China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a13d3dabfae646d537833"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b153e1cd8e14a32552eb"",""name"":""Guizhong Liu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University School of Electronics and Information Engineering 710049 Shannxi China 710049 Shannxi China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42cf9dabfaec09f10ebff"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b153e1cd8e14a32552eb"",""name"":""Tongyu Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University School of Electronics and Information Engineering 710049 Shannxi China 710049 Shannxi China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11760-007-0002-y,"[""Macroblock"",""Context-adaptive variable-length coding"",""Algorithm"",""Coding (social sciences"",""Compression ratio"",""Quantization (signal processing"",""Mathematics"",""Rate–distortion optimization"",""Encoding (memory"",""Context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding""]",,18631711,1,"[""avc · h.264 · intra prediction · jvt · video coding · adaptive threshold · integer transform"",""adaptive thresholding"",""compression ratio"",""mean absolute error"",""rate distortion optimization""]",en,22,27,11,null,"[""53e9bb9bb7602d97047e47d9"",""53e9a0d2b7602d97029bd14b"",""53e9b750b7602d97042ef51c"",""53e9a576b7602d9702e9dd22"",""53e9b93eb7602d97045270c3"",""558a5fefe4b0b32fcb367036"",""558a78cb84ae84d265bdd0cc""]",Fast mode decision algorithm for intra prediction in H.264/AVC with integer transform and adaptive threshold,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11760-007-0002-y"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11760-007-0002-y""]","{""_id"":""555036f27cea80f954168662"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Image, Video, and Multidimensional Signal Processing Workshop (IVMSP)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Signal, Image and Video Processing"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",1,2007,Signal Image Video Process.,"Image, Video, and Multidimensional Signal Processing Workshop (IVMSP)","{""_id"":""53f42cf9dabfaec09f10ebff"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b153e1cd8e14a32552eb"",""name"":""Tongyu Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Xi’an Jiaotong University School of Electronics and Information Engineering 710049 Shannxi China 710049 Shannxi China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2b81c455f439fe3dc31"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[22],1

From a single video sequence with a moving foreground object and stationary background, our algorithm combines background subtraction, color and contrast cues to extract a foreground layer accurately and efficiently. The key idea in background cut is background con- trast attenuation, which adaptively attenuates the contrasts in the background while preserving the contrasts across foreground/background boundaries. Our algorithm builds upon a key observation that the contrast (or more precisely, color image gradient in the background is dissimilar to the contrast across fore- ground/background boundaries in most cases. Using background cut, the layer extraction errorscaused by background cluttercan be substantially reduced. More- over, we present an adaptive mixture model of global and per-pixel background colors toimprove the robustnessofour systemundervarious background changes. Experimental results of high quality composite video demonstrate the effective- ness of our background cut algorithm.","[{""_id"":""53f43097dabfaedf4353f3bc"",""bio"":null,""email"":""jiansun@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b86b6c4e1cd8e14a34cbabc"",""name"":""Jian Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":""544bd93845ce266baea82e9d"",""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, P.R.

 In this paper, a new system called ridgelets frame in L2 (R2 is constructed. To construct the new system, we use other orthonormal wavelet rather than Meyer wavelet, which was used
 in the construction of orthonormal ridgelets by Donoho. Due to the losing of two special closure properties of Meyer wavelet,
 the new system is a tight frame with frame bound 1 instead of orthonormal basis for L2 (R2. As an example, we demonstrate the potential power of the new constructed system by showing its ability of recovering the
 line structure in images in the presence of noise.

 Knowledge representation and inference is a key issue of Knowledge Grid. This paper proposes Knowledge Map (KM model for
 representing and reasoning causal knowledge as an overlay in Knowledge Grid. It extends Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM to represent
 and infer not only cause-effect causal relations, but also time-delay causal relations, conditional probabilistic causal relations
 and sequential relations. Mathematical model and inference rules of KM are presented. Simulations show that KM is more powerful
 than FCM in emulating real world.

Xiangqian Wu,53e997f1b7602d9701ff1f66,"Traditional cryptosystems are based on passwords, which can be cracked (simple ones or forgotten (complex ones. This paper
 proposes a novel cryptosystem based on palmprints. This system directly uses the palmprint as a key to encrypt/decrypt information.
 The information of a palmprint is so complex that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to crack the system while it need
 not remember anything to use the system. In the encrypting phase, a 1024 bits binary string is extracted from the palmprints
 using differential operations. Then the string is translated to a 128 bits encrypting key using a Hash function, and at the
 same time, an error-correct-code (ECC is generated. Some general encryption algorithms use the 128 bits encrypting key to
 encrypt the secret information. In decrypting phase, the 1024 bits binary string extracted from the input palmprint is first
 corrected using the ECC. Then the corrected string is translated to a decrypting key using the same Hash function. Finally,
 the corresponding general decryption algorithms use decrypting key to decrypt the information. The experimental results show
 that the accuracy and security of this system can meet the requirement of most applications.

 An algorithm for alternate pattern fill on arbitrary line segments, circular arcs and elliptical arcs is proposed in this
 paper. The algorithm creates an external loop which is a minimal loop that contains a given point. And then, all loops that
 delimit the nested regions for the alternate pattern fill inside the external loop are built. The loop detection is based
 on a new method for searching the leftmost edges. It requires only values of positions, tangent vectors, curvature radii,
 and the first derivatives of curvature radii at intersection points and areas of circles and ellipses. After all necessary
 loops are built, the given pattern is filled in the nested loops inside the external loop. Filling the given pattern in this
 paper is simplified into filling line segment patterns on some parallel lines.

XiaoJia Tang,53e997d1b7602d9701fc7844,"Describing the interactional behavior of rational agents and seeking equilibria are two main domains of game theory. The epistemic
 foundation of the above two domains is based on the assumption that all players are rational. However, game theory itself
 cannot precisely model the higher-order information changes of mutual knowledge among players, so in the current studies of
 game theory the interpretations of rationality are vague. In this paper, a concept of the rationality is redefined through
 incorporating an epistemic ingredient. Then a method is proposed to solve and refine Nash equilibria which is grounded on
 public announcement logic, and it is proved that the iterated announcement of this rationality assertion characterizes the
 iterated admissibility algorithm in game theory, which offers a dynamic epistemic foundation for this algorithm. Finally,
 an implementation of this method, based on the extended DEMO, is shown to be correct.","[{""_id"":""542ce599dabfae4b91c2cdf9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b869d13e1cd8e14a3a02894"",""name"":""JianYing Cui"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest University Institute of Logic and Intelligence Chongqing 400715 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b35e1c455f439fe42616"",""orgs"":[""Southwest Univ, Inst Log & Intelligence, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f471a4dabfaee02adc0c34"",""bio"":null,""email"":""tangxj@swu.edu.cn"",""gid"":""5b869d13e1cd8e14a3a02894"",""name"":""XiaoJia Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Southwest University Institute of Logic and Intelligence Chongqing 400715 China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b35e1c455f439fe42616"",""orgs"":[""Southwest Univ, Inst Log & Intelligence, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/s11432-010-4010-0,"[""Mathematical economics"",""Rationality"",""Rational agent"",""Best response"",""Implementation theory"",""Non-credible threat"",""Game theory"",""Normal-form game"",""Nash equilibrium"",""Mathematics""]",,18622836,7,"[""game theory"",""rational agent"",""higher order"",""nash equilibria""]",en,4,1368,1358,null,"[""53e9a3b3b7602d9702cc39d6"",""56d90d12dabfae2eee23a549"",""53e9a42bb7602d9702d48474"",""53e9b572b7602d97040ab1f5"",""53e99cfcb7602d97025af166"",""53e99d45b7602d97025fd240"",""53e9ac3db7602d9703606fb6""]",A method for solving Nash equilibria of games based on public announcement logic,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-010-4010-0"",""https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11432-010-4010-0"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555036b77cea80f95414b7de"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Science China Information Sciences"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",53,2010,Sci.

Xiaofang Zhou,53e997f1b7602d9701fee626,"
 The aim of duplicate detection is to group records in a relation which refer to the same entity in the real world such as
 a person or business. Most existing works require user specified parameters such as similarity threshold in order to conduct
 duplicate detection. These methods are called user-first in this paper. However, in many scenarios, pre-specification from
 the user is very hard and often unreliable, thus limiting applicability of user-first methods. In this paper, we propose a
 user-last method, called Active Duplicate Detection (ADD, where an initial solution is returned without forcing user to specify such parameters and then user is involved to refine
 the initial solution. Different from user-first methods where user makes decision before any processing, ADD allows user to
 make decision based on an initial solution. The identified initial solution in ADD enjoys comparatively high quality and is
 easy to be refined in a systematic way (at almost zero cost.

Xiaoou Tang,53e9979fb7602d9701f71557,"In this paper, we introduce background cut, a high quality and real- time foreground layer extraction algorithm. From a single video sequence with a moving foreground object and stationary background, our algorithm combines background subtraction, color and contrast cues to extract a foreground layer accurately and efficiently. The key idea in background cut is background con- trast attenuation, which adaptively attenuates the contrasts in the background while preserving the contrasts across foreground/background boundaries. Our algorithm builds upon a key observation that the contrast (or more precisely, color image gradient in the background is dissimilar to the contrast across fore- ground/background boundaries in most cases. Using background cut, the layer extraction errorscaused by background cluttercan be substantially reduced. More- over, we present an adaptive mixture model of global and per-pixel background colors toimprove the robustnessofour systemundervarious background changes. Experimental results of high quality composite video demonstrate the effective- ness of our background cut algorithm.","[{""_id"":""53f43097dabfaedf4353f3bc"",""bio"":null,""email"":""jiansun@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b86b6c4e1cd8e14a34cbabc"",""name"":""Jian Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":""544bd93845ce266baea82e9d"",""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, P.R.

Xiaoshi Zhong,53e997ccb7602d9701fbf933,"Observation on query log of search engine indicates that queries are usually ambiguous. Similar to document ranking, search intents should be ranked to facilitate information search. Previous work attempts to rank intents with merely relevance score. We argue that diversity is also important. In this work, unified models are proposed to rank intents underlying a query by combining relevance score and diversity degree, in which the latter is reflected by non-overlapping ratio of every intent and aggregated non-overlapping ratio of a set of intents. Three conclusions are drawn according to the experiment results. Firstly, diversity plays an important role in intent ranking. Secondly, URL is more effective than similarity in detecting unique subtopics. Thirdly, the aggregated non-overlapping ratio makes some contribution in similarity based intent ranking but little in URL based intent ranking. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[{""_id"":""53f4542edabfaec09f1fe41d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yunqing Xia"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f433c2dabfaee0d9b4b7a9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaoshi Zhong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f437b5dabfaee1c0aa9512"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guoyu Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5409580ddabfae450f47981d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Junjun Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a4637dabfae646d547b98"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiang Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa115adabfae7f97b04ca8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Thomas Fang Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f456abdabfaedd74e2f16a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qinan Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43325dabfaee43ec0e0ed"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Sen Na"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4d485dabfaeedd0782335"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaohai Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23,"[""Search engine"",""Query log"",""Information retrieval"",""Ranking"",""Computer science"",""Ranking (information retrieval""]",,16113349,null,"[""aggregated non-overlapping ratio"",""diversity"",""intent ranking"",""non-overlapping ratio"",""relevance""]",en,2,271,266,null,"[""53e9b180b7602d9703c068bd"",""573697446e3b12023e6319c1"",""573697446e3b12023e631ab0"",""573697446e3b12023e631cdc"",""573697446e3b12023e631a50"",""53e99a14b7602d970226763d"",""573697446e3b12023e631aa1"",""53e9b50bb7602d97040406b8""]",Ranking Search Intents Underlying a Query.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23""]","{""_id"":""5550379f7cea80f954193043"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""NLDB"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7934 LNCS,2013,Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases,International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases (NLDB),"{""_id"":""53f433c2dabfaee0d9b4b7a9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaoshi Zhong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[2],1

Yang Li,53e997c1b7602d9701fad71c,"Suppose that n nodes with n 0 acquaintances per node are randomly deployed in a two-dimensional Euclidean space with the geographic restriction that each pair of nodes can exchange information between them directly only if the distance between them is at most r, the acquaintanceship between nodes forms a random graph, while the physical communication links constitute a random geometric graph. To get a fully connected and secure network, we introduce secrecy transfer which combines random graph and random geometric graph via the propagation of acquaintanceship to produce an acquaintanceship graph G n,n0, a kind of random geometric graph with each edge representing an acquaintanceship between two nodes. We find that components of graph G n,n0 that undergoes a phase transition from small components to a giant component when n 0 is larger than a threshold, the threshold for G n,n0 to be a connected graph is derived.

Land resource is not only the natural carrier of carbon emission of land ecosystems, but also the spatial carrier of carbon emission from human society. Human activity and its carbon emission intension have a very close relationship with the land use pattern, exploration on the low-carbon oriented land use scope, and land use structure can effectively reduce the rate of carbon emission, and also provides consults to low-carbon oriented land use planning. This paper presents a multi-objective land use optimization model based on low-carbon development. Carbon emission, economic benefit objectives, and constraint conditions are integrated into the multi-objectives optimization model of land use, and the model was solved with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II. And through providing weight coefficients to the objective functions, land use patterns in three scenarios (low-carbon, mid-carbon, high-carbon were obtained. © 2013 IEEE.","[{""_id"":""53f430e5dabfaedf4354318b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Wenlong Jing"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42c98dabfaedd74d2b26e"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Heli Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""543332eddabfaeb43f2a6d38"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaochen Qin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5601a67845cedb3395e86931"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Chao Sun"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""544866f0dabfae87b7e1ab61"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lin Jiang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""56cb1898c35f4f3c65653a17"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jincai Zhao"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1109/Geoinformatics.2013.6626051,"[""Land information system"",""Hydrology"",""Sorting"",""Environmental science"",""Air pollution"",""Land cover"",""Genetic algorithm"",""Carbon"",""Land use"",""Land-use planning"",""Agricultural engineering""]",,21610258,null,"[""land use optimization"",""low-carbon development"",""nsga-ii"",""optimization"",""sociology"",""carbon dioxide"",""economics"",""air pollution"",""linear programming"",""ecology"",""statistics"",""genetic algorithms""]",en,1,5,1,null,"[""53e9b010b7602d9703a65a43""]",Multi-objective land use optimization based on low-carbon development using NSGA-II.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/Geoinformatics.2013.6626051""]","{""_id"":""5550370f7cea80f9541711fe"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Conference on Geoinformatics"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""Geoinformatics"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",null,2013,International Conference on Geoinformatics,ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS),"{""_id"":""543332eddabfaeb43f2a6d38"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaochen Qin"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[1],1
Yaohai Huang,53e997ccb7602d9701fbf933,"Observation on query log of search engine indicates that queries are usually ambiguous. Similar to document ranking, search intents should be ranked to facilitate information search. Previous work attempts to rank intents with merely relevance score. We argue that diversity is also important. In this work, unified models are proposed to rank intents underlying a query by combining relevance score and diversity degree, in which the latter is reflected by non-overlapping ratio of every intent and aggregated non-overlapping ratio of a set of intents. Three conclusions are drawn according to the experiment results. Firstly, diversity plays an important role in intent ranking. Secondly, URL is more effective than similarity in detecting unique subtopics. Thirdly, the aggregated non-overlapping ratio makes some contribution in similarity based intent ranking but little in URL based intent ranking. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[{""_id"":""53f4542edabfaec09f1fe41d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yunqing Xia"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f433c2dabfaee0d9b4b7a9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaoshi Zhong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f437b5dabfaee1c0aa9512"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guoyu Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5409580ddabfae450f47981d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Junjun Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a4637dabfae646d547b98"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiang Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa115adabfae7f97b04ca8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Thomas Fang Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f456abdabfaedd74e2f16a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qinan Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43325dabfaee43ec0e0ed"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Sen Na"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4d485dabfaeedd0782335"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaohai Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23,"[""Search engine"",""Query log"",""Information retrieval"",""Ranking"",""Computer science"",""Ranking (information retrieval""]",,16113349,null,"[""aggregated non-overlapping ratio"",""diversity"",""intent ranking"",""non-overlapping ratio"",""relevance""]",en,2,271,266,null,"[""53e9b180b7602d9703c068bd"",""573697446e3b12023e6319c1"",""573697446e3b12023e631ab0"",""573697446e3b12023e631cdc"",""573697446e3b12023e631a50"",""53e99a14b7602d970226763d"",""573697446e3b12023e631aa1"",""53e9b50bb7602d97040406b8""]",Ranking Search Intents Underlying a Query.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23""]","{""_id"":""5550379f7cea80f954193043"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""NLDB"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7934 LNCS,2013,Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases,International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases (NLDB),"{""_id"":""53f4d485dabfaeedd0782335"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaohai Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[2],1

In the algorithm, the mean shift algorithm with a boundary confidence prior is introduced to efficiently pre-segment the original image into homogeneous regions (super-pixels with precise boundary. Secondly, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM clustering algorithm is used to describe and to model the super-pixels.

Yazhou Liu,53e997f9b7602d9702002764,"
 We describe a method for objective and quantitative evaluation of image quality. The method represents a novel use of image
 enhancement concepts. It employs three new measures that evaluate the definition of contours, uniform intensity distribution,
 and noise rate in determining the image quality. Because the three measures have clear physical meanings, they can be selectively
 applied according to the viewer’s evaluation criteria. The three measures are relatively inexpensive to compute, making them
 suitable for automated ranking of image quality in personal digital imaging devices, such as digital cameras. However, the
 method is equally adept at evaluating other digital images such as those on the Internet. Experiments with the method show
 good correlation with visual quality assessment for various image subject types.

However, the use of a topic model solely sometimes unable to achieve the expected high performance, it is very necessary to improve the current topic model to cope with the characteristic of texts and specific requirements. In this paper, we focus on two tasks. One is to make use of different external corpus to identify topics from texts for better categorization. The other is to add the weight of a few features in texts to get some other topics from those of topic model. We further evaluate the performance of the two tasks with baseline results. The experiments show that our proposed method can achieve a higher accuracy in text classification.

Yongguang Zhang,53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b,"A fundamental challenge in data center networking is how to efficiently interconnect an exponentially increasing number of servers. This paper presents DCell, a novel network structure that has many desirable features for data center networking. DCell is a recursively defined structure, in which a high-level DCell is constructed from many low-level DCells and DCells at the same level are fully connected with one another. DCell scales doubly exponentially as the node degree increases. DCell is fault tolerant since it does not have single point of failure and its distributed fault-tolerant routing protocol performs near shortest-path routing even in the presence of severe link or node failures. DCell also provides higher network capacity than the traditional tree-based structure for various types of services. Furthermore, DCell can be incrementally expanded and a partial DCell provides the same appealing features. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that DCell is a viable interconnection structure for data centers.","[{""_id"":""53f7a457dabfae9060ad6dfd"",""bio"":null,""email"":""chguo@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Chuanxiong Guo"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a50f5dabfae61d4969d02"",""bio"":null,""email"":""hwu@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Haitao Wu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""54084fdedabfae44f087b22e"",""bio"":null,""email"":""kuntan@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Kun Tan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f5634adabfae5e5bf80463"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Lei Shi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4630fdabfaeb22f52f212"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ygz@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Yongguang Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4792fdabfaec09f2882e2"",""bio"":null,""email"":""zslu@cs.ucla.edu"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Songwu Lu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1145/1402946.1402968,"[""Single point of failure"",""Data center network architectures"",""Computer science"",""Server"",""Computer network"",""Network topology"",""Bisection bandwidth"",""Fault tolerance"",""Distributed computing"",""Routing protocol"",""Scalability""]",,01464833,4,"[""data center"",""network topology"",""throughput"",""fault tolerance""]",en,1143,86,75,https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/53e997d1b7602d9701fc217b_0.pdf,"[""53e99d4bb7602d9702602ec7"",""53e99adcb7602d9702360f1e"",""53e9ac2eb7602d97035f4104"",""599c7f2d601a182cd28f68d5"",""53e9ab69b7602d970350990d"",""557cf1336feeaa8086da40ad"",""53e99b78b7602d970241f5f5"",""53e99cfdb7602d97025b2103"",""55827efb0cf2bf7bae57aa4e"",""53e9bb52b7602d9704790954""]",Dcell: a scalable and fault-tolerant network structure for data centers,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402946.1402968"",""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1402958.1402968"",""http://www.webofknowledge.com/""]","{""_id"":""555037717cea80f9541880b1"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""ACM SIGCOMM Conference (SIGCOMM)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""SIGCOMM"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",38,2008,SIGCOMM,ACM SIGCOMM Conference (SIGCOMM),"{""_id"":""53f4630fdabfaeb22f52f212"",""bio"":null,""email"":""ygz@microsoft.com"",""gid"":""5b868cc4e1cd8e14a334d19b"",""name"":""Yongguang Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Microsoft Research Asia|Tsinghua University"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3e71c455f439fe46308"",""orgs"":[""Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China""],""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[1143],1

Yue Guan,53e997ddb7602d9701fd5c11,"Nowadays, numerous social videos have pervaded on the Web. Social web videos are characterized with the accompanying rich contextual information which describe the content of videos and thus greatly facilitate video search and browsing. Generally those context data such as tags are generated for the whole video, without temporal indication on when they actually appear in the video. However, many tags only describe parts of the video content. Therefore, tag localization, the process of assigning tags to the underlying relevant video segments or frames is gaining increasing research interests and a benchmark dataset for the fair evaluation of tag localization algorithms is highly desirable. In this paper, we describe and release a dataset called DUT-WEBV, which contains 1550 videos collected from YouTube portal by issuing 31 concepts as queries. These concepts cover a wide range of semantic aspects including scenes like ""mountain"", events like ""flood"", objects like ""cows"", sites like ""gas station"", and activities like ""handshaking"", offering great challenges to the tag (i.e., concept localization task. For each video of a tag, we carefully annotate the time durations when the tag appears in the video. Besides the video itself, the contextual information, such as thumbnail images, titles, and categories, is also provided. Together with this benchmark dataset, we present a baseline for tag localization using multiple instance learning approach. Finally, we discuss some open research issues for tag localization in web videos. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","[{""_id"":""54084d74dabfae450f40a183"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Haojie Li"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43277dabfaec09f154ff5"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Lei Yi"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa014edabfae8faa59f244"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yue Guan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4714ddabfaeb22f5592bd"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Hao Zhang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_29,"[""Open research"",""Thumbnail"",""Contextual information"",""World Wide Web"",""Social web"",""Information retrieval"",""Video retrieval"",""Computer science"",""Video annotation"",""Handshaking"",""Context data""]",,16113349,PART 2,"[""tag localization"",""video annotation"",""video retrieval""]",en,10,315,305,null,"[""53e9ba94b7602d97046b9e43"",""53e9b27bb7602d9703d213ed"",""53e998b8b7602d97020f1238"",""53e99e31b7602d97026f707b"",""53e9bb8cb7602d97047d329e"",""53e9bda5b7602d9704a4f32a"",""53e9b03db7602d9703a9b031"",""53e9b8c1b7602d97044a2ec0"",""53e9a2b9b7602d9702bc019e"",""53e99f64b7602d97028348f5"",""53e9a04ab7602d97029326c3"",""53e99e94b7602d970275cb91"",""53e9b937b7602d97045221ad"",""53e99c52b7602d9702500b5f"",""558c5f1784ae6766fdf2b146"",""53e9a7b3b7602d97030eca94"",""53e9b3d4b7602d9703ebe970"",""53e99a6eb7602d97022dfb95"",""53e9b627b7602d970417fdae""]",DUT-WEBV: A Benchmark Dataset for Performance Evaluation of Tag Localization for Web Video.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35728-2_29""]","{""_id"":""53a72cac20f7420be8c4c673"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Conference on Multimedia Modeling"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""MMM (2"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7733 LNCS,2013,Conference on Multimedia Modeling,International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP),"{""_id"":""53fa014edabfae8faa59f244"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yue Guan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[10],1
Yuliang Zheng,53e997f5b7602d9701ff9b96,"Signcryption is a public key cryptographic technique that is particularly suited for mobile communications thanks to its light computational and communication overhead. The wide spread use of signcryption in a mobile computing environment, however, is accompanied by an increased risk of private key exposure. This paper addresses the issue of key exposure by proposing a key-insulated signcryption technique. We define a security model for key-insulated signcryption and prove that the keyinsulated signcryption technique is provably secure in the security model. © J.UCS.","[{""_id"":""53f44606dabfaee02ad17606"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Jia Fan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f59a6bdabfaeeb6ff8045b"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yuliang Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43aa7dabfaedd74dc9450"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaohu Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",null,"[""Mobile computing"",""Computer science"",""Cryptography"",""Computer security"",""Computer network"",""Signcryption"",""Increased risk"",""Public-key cryptography"",""Mobile telephony"",""Computer security model""]",null,09486968,10,"[""Key exposure"",""Key insulation"",""Signcryption""]",en,1,1374,1351,,"[""53e9be2db7602d9704ae7866"",""53e9a87eb7602d97031cbe14"",""5c8a72b04895d9cbc62b1797"",""53e9bc8fb7602d970491085f"",""53e99d45b7602d97025fe7c2"",""53e99b94b7602d970243a602"",""53e9a0edb7602d97029d61ad"",""53e9a171b7602d9702a63c64"",""53e9ad8db7602d9703785952"",""53e99a92b7602d970230bb1e"",""53e9b0d1b7602d9703b4d536"",""53e9ad4eb7602d9703732563"",""53e9b137b7602d9703bb935d"",""53e9b042b7602d9703aa3e26"",""56d833a2dabfae2eee320244"",""53e9b4dfb7602d97040019a8"",""53e9b5bcb7602d97041018ec"",""53e99dc4b7602d970268290c""]",Key-Insulated Signcryption.,"[""http://www.jucs.org/jucs_19_10/key_insulated_signcryption""]","{""_id"":""555036de7cea80f954161ba8"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""The Journal of Universal Computer Science"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""J.

Yunqing Xia,53e997ccb7602d9701fbf933,"Observation on query log of search engine indicates that queries are usually ambiguous. Similar to document ranking, search intents should be ranked to facilitate information search. Previous work attempts to rank intents with merely relevance score. We argue that diversity is also important. In this work, unified models are proposed to rank intents underlying a query by combining relevance score and diversity degree, in which the latter is reflected by non-overlapping ratio of every intent and aggregated non-overlapping ratio of a set of intents. Three conclusions are drawn according to the experiment results. Firstly, diversity plays an important role in intent ranking. Secondly, URL is more effective than similarity in detecting unique subtopics. Thirdly, the aggregated non-overlapping ratio makes some contribution in similarity based intent ranking but little in URL based intent ranking. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","[{""_id"":""53f4542edabfaec09f1fe41d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yunqing Xia"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f433c2dabfaee0d9b4b7a9"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Xiaoshi Zhong"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f437b5dabfaee1c0aa9512"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Guoyu Tang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5409580ddabfae450f47981d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Junjun Wang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""542a4637dabfae646d547b98"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qiang Zhou"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53fa115adabfae7f97b04ca8"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Thomas Fang Zheng"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f456abdabfaedd74e2f16a"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Qinan Hu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f43325dabfaee43ec0e0ed"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Sen Na"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f4d485dabfaeedd0782335"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yaohai Huang"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23,"[""Search engine"",""Query log"",""Information retrieval"",""Ranking"",""Computer science"",""Ranking (information retrieval""]",,16113349,null,"[""aggregated non-overlapping ratio"",""diversity"",""intent ranking"",""non-overlapping ratio"",""relevance""]",en,2,271,266,null,"[""53e9b180b7602d9703c068bd"",""573697446e3b12023e6319c1"",""573697446e3b12023e631ab0"",""573697446e3b12023e631cdc"",""573697446e3b12023e631a50"",""53e99a14b7602d970226763d"",""573697446e3b12023e631aa1"",""53e9b50bb7602d97040406b8""]",Ranking Search Intents Underlying a Query.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38824-8_23""]","{""_id"":""5550379f7cea80f954193043"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""NLDB"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",7934 LNCS,2013,Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases,International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Data Bases (NLDB),"{""_id"":""53f4542edabfaec09f1fe41d"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":null,""name"":""Yunqing Xia"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":null,""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":null,""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[2],1

Zhaozhong Wang,53e997f8b7602d9702000ef0,"Exemplar-based inpainting techniques demonstrate some advantages in filling both textural and structural images, based upon
 the simple process of patch sampling and copying. An implicit assumption of such methods is that an exemplar patch could be
 found for copying. But the assumption might be false for images with complex structures, resulting in inpainting artefact.
 To inpaint structure and texture more efficiently, this paper adopts a weak assumption that affine transformed patches could
 be found for filling unknown regions. The algorithm based on this assumption firstly establishes the affine relation between
 the unknown region and a source patch, then transform the source pixels to fill the unknowns. This algorithm generates more
 satisfying inpainting results, as illustrated by the provided experiments.

To get a fully connected and secure network, we introduce secrecy transfer which combines random graph and random geometric graph via the propagation of acquaintanceship to produce an acquaintanceship graph G n,n0, a kind of random geometric graph with each edge representing an acquaintanceship between two nodes. We find that components of graph G n,n0 that undergoes a phase transition from small components to a giant component when n 0 is larger than a threshold, the threshold for G n,n0 to be a connected graph is derived.

Experimental results show that our approach is more effective on both synthetic datasets and UCI datasets compared with the cop-kmeans algorithm and ant-based clustering algorithm. © 2011 IEEE.","[{""_id"":""5440babfdabfae805a6ebdae"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c90ec"",""name"":""Xiao-hua Xu"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Yangzhou University(Yangzhou University,Yangzhou,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3af1c455f439fe4490e"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f42d55dabfaec09f113dfb"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c90ec"",""name"":""Zhou-Jin Pan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Yangzhou University(Yangzhou University,Yangzhou,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3af1c455f439fe4490e"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""5601a9d145cedb3395e8991f"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b7f6e1cd8e14a3554d9c"",""name"":""Ping He"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics(Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Nanjing Univ. of Aero. and Astron.,Nanjing,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b2c81c455f439fe3e349"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null},{""_id"":""53f6415bdabfae8d549bf1b6"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c90ec"",""name"":""Ling Chen"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Yangzhou University(Yangzhou University,Yangzhou,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3af1c455f439fe4490e"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}]",10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016967,"[""Data mining"",""Canopy clustering algorithm"",""CURE data clustering algorithm"",""Clustering high-dimensional data"",""Correlation clustering"",""Pattern recognition"",""Computer science"",""FLAME clustering"",""Artificial intelligence"",""Constrained clustering"",""Cluster analysis"",""DBSCAN""]",,21601348,null,"[""ant clustering"",""constrained clustering"",""random walk"",""algorithm design"",""particle swarm optimization"",""clustering algorithms"",""machine learning"",""data analysis"",""cybernetics"",""ant colony"",""algorithm design and analysis""]",en,1,1570,1566,null,"[""53e9bd4bb7602d97049da90a"",""53e9b331b7602d9703e0331c"",""53e9bafbb7602d970472f115"",""53e9ba38b7602d970464688c"",""53e998dbb7602d97021136b2"",""53e9af06b7602d970393a68e"",""53e99a43b7602d97022a0710"",""53e99a3cb7602d9702297d68"",""53e9b740b7602d97042dbe02""]",Constrained ant clustering.,"[""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016967"",""http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016967""]","{""_id"":""555037d07cea80f95419b1a5"",""issn"":null,""name"":null,""name_d"":""International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing (ICMLC)"",""name_s"":null,""online_issn"":null,""publisher"":null,""raw"":""ICMLC"",""raw_zh"":null,""sid"":null,""src"":null,""t"":null,""type"":0}",4,2011,ICMLC,International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing (ICMLC),"{""_id"":""53f42d55dabfaec09f113dfb"",""bio"":null,""email"":null,""gid"":""5b86b6bfe1cd8e14a34c90ec"",""name"":""Zhou-Jin Pan"",""name_zh"":null,""oid"":null,""oid_zh"":null,""orcid"":null,""org"":""Yangzhou University(Yangzhou University,Yangzhou,China"",""org_zh"":null,""orgid"":""5f71b3af1c455f439fe4490e"",""orgs"":null,""orgs_zh"":null,""sid"":null}",[1],1

Zu-yuan Yang,53e997ddb7602d9701fd32c9,"A novel sparse measure of signal is proposed and the efficient number of sources is estimated by the best confidence limit
 in this work. The observations are classified by SVM trained through samples which are constructed by direction angle of sources.
 And columns of the mixing matrix corresponding to clustering centers of each class are obtained based on the sum of samples
 belong to the same class with different weights which are adjusted adaptively. It gets out of the trap of the initial values
 which interfere k-mean clustering quite a lot. Furthermore, the online algorithm for estimating basis matrix is proposed for
 large scale samples. The shortest path method is used to recover the source signals after estimating the mixing matrix. The
 favorable simulations show the stability and robustness of the algorithms.
