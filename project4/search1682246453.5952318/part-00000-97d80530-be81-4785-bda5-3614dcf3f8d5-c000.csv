5550471745ce0a409eb6469d,Stabilization of positive switched delay systems with a hysteresis switching law,"This paper is concerned with the problem of stabilization for positive switched delay systems. A hysteresis switching law is designed to stabilize positive switched systems with a time delay. On one hand, such switching laws can eliminate the chattering resulting from state-dependent switching laws. On the other hand, a constant time delay may sometimes lead to the instability of positive switched systems. Sufficient conditions on the existence of hysteresis switching laws are presented by making use of linear programming approach. The validity of the proposed approaches is illustrated by a numerical example.",0.8633739
5c757cfdf56def9798a950c8,Stabilization of networked control systems using a mixed-mode based switched delay system method,"The phenomenon of mixed-mode is one of the most important characteristics of switched delay systems. If a networked control system (NCS with network induced delays and packet dropouts (NIDs & PDs is recast as a switched delay system, it is imperative to consider the effects of mixed-modes in the stability analysis for an NCS. In this paper, with the help of the interpolatory quadrature formula a...",0.85123605

5c5ce4fd17c44a400fc389f6,On asymptotic characterization of destabilizing switching signals for switched linear systems.,"This paper deals with classes of (destabilizing switching signals for switched systems. Most of the available conditions for stability of switched systems are sufficient in nature, and consequently, their violation does not conclude instability of a switched system. The study of instability is, however, important for obvious reasons. Our contributions are twofold: Firstly, we propose a class of switching signals under which a continuous-time switched linear system is unstable. Our characterization of instability depends solely on the asymptotic behaviour of frequency of switching, frequency of transition between subsystems, and fraction of activation of subsystems. Secondly, we show that our class of destabilizing switching signals is a strict subset of the class of switching signals that does not satisfy asymptotic characterization of stability recently proposed in the literature. This observation identifies a gap between asymptotic characterizations of stabilizing and destabilizing switching signals for switched linear systems. The main apparatus for our analysis is multiple Lyapunov-like functions.",0.8452473
